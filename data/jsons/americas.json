{"Michael Ackerman": "Principal Consultant, Teaching & Technology Innovators Former Assistant Director, High Performance Computing and Communications, US National Library of Medicine I have always had a great interest in what lies between classic academic subjects and have the belief that great advances come from the space between formal disciplines. In 1972, I graduated from the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill with a Ph.D. in Biomedical Mathematics and Medical Engineering. My thesis was interdisciplinary, combining neurophysiology and computer-based real-time data acquisition and analysis. My Master\u2019s thesis, three years earlier, dealt with similar interdisciplinary themes. Upon graduation I was inducted as an officer into the US Navy Medical Service Corp. Although I was classified as a physiologist and assigned to the Naval Medical Research Institute in Bethesda, MD, my boss encouraged me to develop tools and methods based on my computer background. My research involved the exploration of the effects of high atmospheric pressure on the mammalian nervous system. But the methods I developed relied heavily on real time computer acquisition and analysis of physiological data. I was deeply involved in the computer-based part of Biomedical Engineering and had never heard of nor thought about Medical Informatics. I was a member of the Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS) of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (IEEE). The newsletter announced that the Society had joined in sponsoring a new symposium, the Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care (SCAMC), to be held in Washington, DC in 1977 and was looking for a volunteer to represent the Society\u2019s interests. The symposium theme contained many elements that matched my interests, especially real-time physiological data acquisition and analysis. So I volunteered and was accepted. The new symposium was the brainchild of Abund Wist, PhD, of Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) in Richmond, VA, and Helmuth \u201cHeli\u201d Orthner, PhD, of George Washington University (GWU) in Washington, DC. The Organizing Committee was largely made up of engineers from the greater Washington area who were interested in the potential that computers might have when applied to healthcare. Dr. Orthner was perhaps the only committee member doing research on something that we think of today as mainstream Medical Informatics. Medical Informatics evolved at the same time as SCAMC. The members of the SCAMC Board were the leaders in applying computers to healthcare in the Washington, DC area; they were engineers and physicians; academic, private and government; as well as researchers and administrators, all of whom shared the same interest in encouraging the application of computers to healthcare. My own work, at what became the CIO position at the Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI), included encouraging medical researchers to use computers for data acquisition and analysis using a multi-computer system under a DECNet network with an ARPANET connection. In 1982, the SCAMC Board felt financially secure enough to invite colleagues of similar backgrounds and interest to become members of the Board. Board membership  soon represented the leadership of the computer application to health care community. In 1983, the SCAMC Board made a proposal to the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA). SCAMC proposed that MEDINFO, the triennial international Medical Informatics symposium, be held in Washington, DC, in 1986 with SCAMC as the organizational sponsor. The proposal was accepted and SCAMC became recognized as the pre-eminent annual symposium on Medical Informatics in the United States. Through my position as MEDINFO \u201986 treasurer, I became acquainted with the Medical Informatics leadership from around the world. One of those leaders was on the Editorial Board of the Journal of Medical Practice Management. He asked me if I would like to write a column about the intersection of office computers and office practice management under the heading of Computer Briefs. My first column, in 1988, was so popular that I continued writing it for the next 26 years. It was a pleasure and an honor to identify, write, and publish any computer-based topic that I felt would be of interest to the journal\u2019s subscribers. My professional life\u2019s journey also became more closely associated with Medical Informatics, although not in the mainstream. In 1987, I left the NMRI and became chief of the Educational Technology Branch at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) under Dr. Dan Masys. Dr. Masys recognized and encouraged my interdisciplinary interests. The goal of my Branch was to demonstrate and influence medical school deans to recommend the incorporation of personal computer (PC)\u2013based educational modules for medical student education. We established The Learning Center (TLC) for Interactive Technology at the NLM for that purpose. On a trip to the University of Washington in 1988 I met Dr. Cornelius Rosse, the chairman of the Department of Biological Structure, who suggested that PCs should be used for the teaching of anatomy but that a data set for that purpose was not available. Although at the time I did not know it, with the encouragement of Dr. Harold Schoolman, NLM\u2019s Deputy Director for Research and Education, this was the start of the Visible Human Project and the creation of public domain male and female 3-dimensional data sets with anatomical resolution of 0.33 mm. The male data set, 15 GB, was released in 1994 and the female data set, 40 GB, in 1995. At the time the size of either data set was unprecedented and led to many problems which today would be characterized as Big Data. Almost 25 years later, the download demand for the data sets has not diminished. In 1990, the Electronic Communications Committee of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) visited the TLC. They were interested in setting up an area at the RSNA annual meeting to duplicate the TLC in order to educate the radiology community about the value of PC-based education. A small demonstration area was set up and tested at the 1990 meeting. In 1991, the InfoRad (Informatics in Radiology) area saw its debut. InfoRad featured a computer-based poster area, an area in which Grateful Med literature searching was taught by members of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine, an area of hands-on PC-based educational demonstrations provided by NLM staff, and a 100-seat theater in which a series of computer-based education lectures were presented by NLM staff. In 1994, Dr. Donald A. B. Lindberg, the Director of NLM, asked me to organize and lead the new NLM Office for High Performance Computing and Communications (OHPCC) as the NLM Assistant Director for HPCC. NLM was the lead agency for HHS in the 12-agency interdisciplinary HPCC Program. At NLM we considered \u201cComputing\u201d to pertain to medical imaging and \u201cCommunications\u201d to pertain to telemedicine. This fit very nicely into the work already being performed or sponsored by NLM. Over the next 10 years, my OHPCC colleagues and I were responsible for over $10M a year worth of  contracts and in-house research which blended healthcare with computational and networking tools. Many of these demonstration projects have become standard practice today. We demonstrated the ability of a hospital-based neurologist to monitor a stroke examination in an ambulance still en route to the hospital. This required the use of four simultaneous analog cell phone channels, each channel with a top speed of 56 kilobits per second. In the 1990\u2019s, a high-speed landline internet connection was only 1 megabit per second. Even at that speed our projects demonstrated realtime tele-dermatology, diabetic retinopathy screening, health support for home ageing-in-place, and expert distance support for trauma care. Using declassified algorithms for secure data transmission, the secure HIPAA-compliant exchange of medical records and mammograms was demonstrated. With the availability of the public internet, the TLC moved from local PC-based interactive education to network-based live interactive education. In 1994, in order to demonstrate this technology at InfoRad, we arranged for the first high-speed Internet connection to be brought into Chicago\u2019s McCormick Place, the location of the RSNA annual meeting. Soon after Wi-Fi became available, we introduced, demonstrated, and made the technology available in the Exhibit Hall at the 1995 American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) annual meeting. Feedback from those using the data from the Visible Human Project pointed out the need for a software package that could accomplish the segmentation and registration of 3-dimensional data like the Visible Human data sets. My HPCC imaging informatics group was up to the challenge. In 1999, we began the process of creating the Insight Tool Kit (ITK), an open source code set capable of multi-dimensional image segmentation and registration. We served as the scientific lead with six other organizations. ITK was completed and released in 2003, and it remains continuously updated and improved by HPCC through an open source consortium. It is used by many academic and commercial research groups including manufacturers of commercial imaging products such as General Electric and Siemens. Given the ability to find a specific face in a crowd, I reasoned that we should be able to match a picture of an unknown prescription pill to a catalog of pictures of known prescription pills. A federally sponsored challenge designed to solve this problem was held. Although we did receive some promising solutions, the problem seems to be more difficult than was thought. In order to work on it further, we had to create a catalog of pictures of known prescription pills. NLM\u2019s publically available RXImage data base is approaching 5,000 front and back images of prescription pills. NLM has been presenting its Medical Informatics week-long course since 1992. In 2001, I was asked to join the course as a faculty member. Since then I have presented lectures on Imaging Informatics, Next Generation Internet, Big Data and the Cloud, and Telemedicine and m-Health. I always spent the week with the class, becoming acquainted with the students and providing mentorship. In 2014, I was asked to serve as the Co-Educational Director for the course. My success and the success of the course were only possible thanks to my colleagues in Medical Informatics who agreed to serve in a lectureship capacity. Forty-five years have passed since I graduated in 1972. I spent that time in government, but also in the academic space between Biomedical Engineering and Medical Informatics. I was lucky to have supervisors who supported risk and encouraged interdisciplinary exploration. Most of my mentors and colleagues have been the people that I met in the Medical Informatics community. I am still having fun and I thank you all. ", "Constantin F. Aliferis": "Professor of Medicine Professor of Data Science Chief Research Informatics Officer Director, Institute for Health Informatics University of Minnesota As a teenager, my first scientific love was physics, while also having a great interest in the rapidly growing field of computing. However, influenced by a very traumatic death in my immediate family I decided that following a career in medicine would allow me to have greater impact, C. F. Aliferis, MD, PhD and be more effective in helping others. Yet, upon entering medical school, I was taken aback by finding how uncomfortably ad-hoc medicine could be. This troubled me, and made me ask: how could medicine become more rigorous, reproducible, and scientific? The literature on Medical Artificial Intelligence, Expert Systems, and Decision Making theory, as well as of Biomedical Informatics gave me hope. The founders and early contributors to our field, through their papers, pioneering systems and discoveries, and with the educational programs they developed, showed that deeper understanding of medicine was feasible through mathematical models and computer programs. As I was learning about biomedical informatics, I was lucky to be taught biostatistics, research design, and epidemiology by a formidable scientist, the late Professor Dimitrios Trichopoulos. He not only imparted extensive, robust knowledge as well as practical data analysis skills, but served as a role model for making internationally recognized contributions in global health as a non-clinical physician-scientist. I saw in his example that there was an option to commit fully to scientific research that would help clinical practice. By the time I graduated from medical school, I had formed a rather sizeable portfolio of local scientific collaborations, with a number of papers and conference presentations both in informatics and epidemiology. I also acquired strong programming skills that led to both research and commercial software. In the summer of 1991, I joined the Intelligent Systems Studies Program (ISSP) at the University of Pittsburgh \u2013 one of the top-10 ranked PhD programs in the US at the time. It covered 3 areas: Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive AI, and Information Management Systems, combined with the NLM-funded training program in Medical Informatics led by Randy Miller. The faculty comprised famous senior AI and Medical Informatics researchers, complemented by great junior faculty many of whom later became themselves distinguished leaders. I was lucky that Professor Gregory (Greg) Cooper selected me to be his research assistant and that my thesis committee also included Professors Bruce Buchanan, Martha Pollack, and Randy Miller. I used to tell them that this committee (that had, among other notable distinctions, th the 14 president of Cornell University, 2 members of NAM and a president of AMIA and ACMI) were a \u201cdream team\u201d for an informatics student! My timing was most propitious, since I became the first student to work with Professor Cooper on his foundational method for learning causal Bayesian Networks (BNs) using Bayesian scoring methods. I was also greatly inspired by Randy Miller\u2019s work on INTERNIST-I and QMR.  In parallel to my MSc and PhD studies which concluded in 1998, I completed a 3.5- year Research Fellowship in Internal Medicine (with a focus on Machine Learning). After this training I returned to Greece and served in the Greek Navy while at the same time I worked as a research scientist in Epidemiology in the Athens School of Medicine. My experiences in medical informatics benefited from the very deep and demanding technical training at ISSP, and by practical biomedical machine learning applications. Today machine learning (ML) is an integral part of analytics, and a new field, Data Science, is based on integrated approaches to analysis. When I was a graduate student, it was almost heresy to suggest that ML could match or perform better in certain problems than classical statistical approaches that were the established paradigm in data analysis. Similarly, the statistical community\u2019s belief system regarding causality was summarized by the motto \u201ccorrelation is not causation\u201d and the mere suggestion that one could learn causality from non-experimental data was viewed with huge skepticism, if not scorn. Today causal discovery methods have become widespread, proven, with several Nobel Prizes and a Turing Award resulting from such methods. Working under my advisor\u2019s guidance I designed, implemented and ran sizeable experiments, evaluating, applying, and enhancing BN learning methods. As faculty later on, I made it an integral part of my R&D pipeline to validate methods with extensive experiments and not to satisfy myself with small-scope evaluations the result of which may not be broadly representative or reproducible. My mentor led a project for modeling risk of mortality from pneumonia with 20+ researchers from CMU and Pittsburgh. This project enabled me to work, among others, with Professors Clark Glymour, Peter Spirtes, and Richard Scheines, who along with Judea Pearl had pioneered a sophisticated, elegant, and complete framework and many powerful algorithms for causal discovery. Pearl received the Turing Award for his work. Back home in Greece, I had been raised to be competitive and a perfectionist. These traits were fertile ground for Greg Cooper\u2019s scientific approach, which led me to a fully- fledged uncompromising attitude toward science, both internally and externally (by internally I mean to not be satisfied unless research claims are reproducible and solve some important problem really well, while by externally I mean to not allow various exigencies to compromise the quality of the research. For example, I experienced the risks of overfitting in the pneumonia project when several researchers analyzed the same data with different techniques. Greg taught me that with proper design safeguards in place, such risks could be eliminated, and I made it a point in my career as faculty to inoculate my research from the dangers of results that do not generalize well due to overfitting. To summarize, the most important seeds my graduate training planted in me were: deep technical training, uncompromising attitude to quality of science, willingness to set very ambitious goals, and valuing teamwork with competent and inspiring colleagues. These seeds translated then into my research as a faculty member in the six areas of 1) the scalable discovery of causal relationships without experimentation, 2) the blending of predictive and causal modeling, 3) the development of scalable, sound, and complete algorithms for model multiplicity, 4) the benchmarking and quality control of informatics; including auto-modelers and causal discovery software, 5) modeling for information retrieval and scientometrics, and 6) diverse applications. For causal discovery, early algorithms in the field were unable to scale with more than approximately 100 variables until approximately 2000. My lab at Vanderbilt University introduced the first local causal discovery algorithms (in 2002) and the first global causal discovery algorithms (2005) that could learn accurate causal models with  thousands of variables, while subsequent generations can cope with millions of variables even with relatively modest computing equipment. We achieved this result, by creating scalable local techniques (i.e., eliciting causality around one target variable only) and then we used divide-and-conquer strategies that moved from local networks to the full causal networks. On the blending of predictive and causal modeling, we focused on the discovery and use of the Markov Boundary (MB) which has both predictive optimality and local causal validity. My group in 2002-2003 developed the first MB algorithms that were scalable, accurate, and sample efficient. Subsequent generations have added many additional capabilities, such as taking into account hidden variables, minimizing the number of experiments, and enabling estimation of effects of causal manipulations. Major contributors to the early research were Professors Ioannis Tsamardinos and Alexander Statnikov. For the issues surrounding scalable, sound and complete algorithms for multiplicity modeling, a complete, efficient, and sound algorithm family that can learn and catalogue all members of a multiplicity class was developed by Alexander Statnikov in his dissertation under my supervision. On issues of benchmarking and quality control, my group developed and implemented intelligent analysis systems exhibiting expert level performance for omics data analysis (GEMS and FAST-Aims) and for High Dimensional Analyses (Causal Explorer package). These methods and tools had more than 4,000 registered software users worldwide. Additional tools were disseminated as part of the Causal Challenge which I co-organized with Professor Isabelle Guyon. Major contributors to these efforts were Professors Alexander Statnikov, Lawrence Fu, Yindalon Aphinyanaphongs, Laura Brown, and Sisi Ma, as well as Dr. Nafeh Fananapazir, with others too many to list here but who appear as co-authors in our related papers, making significant contributions. In terms of concrete biomedical impact, the efforts of methodology innovators find their ultimate vindication in successful applications. Between 2000 and now, my group at Vanderbilt and in the informatics Center and Institute units that I have been fortunate to lead at NYU and the University of Minnesota (UMN) have deployed the above and other methods to address many problems at the frontiers of biomedicine. Ones that I have been closely involved in personally include: 1) Predicting risk for sepsis in the neonatal ICU; 2) Diagnosing stroke according to etiology and differentiating from stroke-like syndromes using proteomic markers; 3) Modeling the decision making and determining guideline non-compliance for dermatologists; 4) Performing enterprise-wide scans and comparisons with regional institutions for NYULMC, revealing opportunities for improving quality of care and efficiencies; 5) Building explanatory, forecasting, and causal models for improving cost of care across the patient body of NYULMC. 6) Predicting lab tests to reduce unnecessary utilization; 7) Creating a molecular precision medicine test for giving Bevacizumab to only those patients with ovarian cancer that will respond to it. My group further pioneered innovative machine learning models that: 8) can very accurately predict citations of articles in deep horizons; 9) Can characterize the nature of citations; 10) Can classify articles in terms of methodological rigor and content; and 11) can scan the WWW for web pages with dangerous health advice. Professors Lawrence Fu and Yindalon Aphinyanaphongs received their PhDs while working on these information retrieval projects and launched successful academic and industry careers. This research also marked the first application of Markov Boundary methods for WWW, medical text, and citation literature analysis. My collaborators and I further: 12) showed that accurate diagnosis of psoriasis can be accomplished using microbiomic  signatures from the skin; 13) Discovered gene signatures characterizing regression of atherosclerosis; 14) Showed that subclinical viral infections can be detected using gene signatures from serum; 15) Used Multiplicity and MB methods for GWAS analysis and showed highly accelerated discovery and reproducible diagnosis; 16) Applied and evaluated MB methods in Microbiomics analysis for the first time; and 17) Applied MB and causal graph methods for automated MS Proteomic spectral analysis for the first time. More recent ongoing work is focused on: 18) using ML for understanding, predicting and preventing childhood PTSD; 19) Discovering miRNAs that control aging; and 20) Work on state-wide deployment of Pharmacogenomics in Minnesota. In addition to the above endeavors, I have had the privilege of architecting the Vanderbilt MS/PhD Program in Biomedical Informatics, and subsequently from 2008 to 2015, I served as Founding Director of the Center for Health Informatics and Bioinformatics at NYU. There I established an academic home for informatics with 18 core faculty; 7 high-impact research labs; in-house high performance computing; 3 informatics cores (CTSI, Cancer Institute, and Environmental science); a best practice\u2013 driven integrative informatics consulting service used by hundreds of investigators; informatics support for all high throughput assays in NYULMC; an operationally oriented healthcare analytics portfolio; and 2 graduate level programs. In June of 2015, I joined the University of Minnesota (UMN) faculty as Director of the Institute for Health Informatics (IHI), Chief Research Informatics Officer and Director of the CTSI Biomedical Informatics Program (BMIP), and Chief Data Analytics Officer for the healthcare system (MHealth). The vision for Informatics at the UMN aspires to: (a) Excellence in informatics science and education; (b) Building informatics infrastructure, collaborative science, and expert consulting for all researchers. The vision of UMN Informatics is to leverage informatics collaboratively to increase the quality, scope, volume, sophistication, speed, and efficiency of research. Finally, we seek to (c) enable thematic areas such as personalized and precision medicine, computational psychiatry, healthcare data science (including that of a Learning Health System), and translational Bioinformatics. The UMN informatics has grown since 2015 to 20 core and 40 affiliate faculty, 4 PhD Tracks, 2 MS programs, 50 matriculated students and 40 staff. The CTSI Informatics program engages and works with thousands of investigators and projects from single-investigator projects, to enterprise, state-wise, and national initiatives. To conclude, the two fundamental principles that drive my academic efforts are that (1) Informatics is not only an \u201cinformation management\u201d endeavor but can also be a rigorous science with critical contributions to scientific discovery; (2) Informatics is a quintessential collaborative discipline that works with other disciplines to create powerful discovery and decision support capabilities through innovation and collaboration. It is only through ambitious innovation, and extensive team science that we can realize the full potential of informatics to change the world\u2019s health for the better. ", "Russ B. Altman": "Kenneth Fong Professor of Bioengineering, Genetics, Medicine, Biomedical Data Science & Computer Science Stanford University Thank you, Steve Jobs, for the jolt! In January 1984, I was a first-year MD/PhD student in a biochemistry lab studying the structure and mechanism of the light-sensitive ion channel, rhodopsin. I had done biochemistry research as an undergraduate at Harvard, with a focus on three-dimensional protein structure analysis. I loved computer programming and R. B. Altman, MD, PhD was an undergraduate teaching assistant for the intro to programming class (which my then-girlfriend, now- wife took\u2014that\u2019s a whole different set of stories\u2026). The undergraduate research had involved both lab work and a substantial amount of computation. I thought I enjoyed both, but I was having doubts\u2014the lab work in graduate school was not going particularly well, and the options for computational analysis were far off\u2014I wouldn\u2019t have any data to compute with for months if not years. By 1984, the tradition of big commercials at the Superbowl was already entrenched, and as I watched the half-time commercials, I saw a striking advertisement in which the Macintosh computer was introduced (in an Orwellian 1984-type scenario; young people should read \u201c1984\u201d and should google the commercial). I found myself incredibly excited about the introduction of this personal computer. Soon afterwards, I was in a long line of students at Pine Hall on the Stanford Campus (I pass Pine Hall every day and still think about these events). We were allowed to walk past the single Macintosh computer on display (think opening scene of \u201cEvita\u201d), type a few characters, and then decide if we wanted to order it or not. I didn\u2019t have the money. But I did know that I wanted computers to be a more prominent part of my life. The rest happened quickly. My medical school classmate and golfing partner, Curt Langlotz, described a program in which he was getting an MS (eventually PhD) degree: Medical Information Sciences. He said it was a fabulous new program, small but emerging, and filled with information science zealots; it was all about using computers in medicine. The program was led by a devoted and visionary faculty member, Ted Shortliffe, an inventor of the MYCIN program for infectious disease diagnosis and treatment advice. I visited Ted and explained that while I loved computational technology, I wanted to apply it to basic biological discovery, and would that be OK for a student in this clinically oriented program. Ted (in the first of several moves that helped my career immensely) said that as long as I took the core curriculum and reasonable electives, I could have my research focus on any topic bringing biology, medicine, computer science, statistics, and decision theory together. This was fabulous news, and I was halfway there. But I still needed a project and mentor. Ted suggested I visit Bruce Buchanan. Bruce had been advisor to Ted on MYCIN and was part of the Knowledge Systems Laboratory at the Stanford Computer Science Department, a lab led by Ed Feigenbaum\u2014  an early pioneer of Expert Systems and Artificial Intelligence. Bruce and Ed had worked in basic science computing as part of the DENDRAL project that automated the analysis of mass spectroscopic data. DENDRAL was led on the chemistry-side by Joshua Lederberg, a Nobel Prize winning visionary scientist who saw the great potential of computational science. Bruce was just starting a collaboration with Oleg Jardetzky in the use of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data to study the three-dimensional structure of proteins. This was something I knew about! NMR data was sparse and noisy, and so it was clear that clever algorithms would be needed to analyze them. Bruce and Oleg had a vision of building an expert system that could analyze all the data and build protein models that were sufficiently precise to understand function and perhaps see how it could be modulated with small molecules, like drugs. This was my dream project, and I joined it immediately\u2014informing my biochemistry mentor that I was switching labs. My PhD dissertation was entitled \u201cExclusion methods for the determination of protein structure from experimental data\u201d and presented two methods for processing the NMR data. One was based on an expert-system type analysis and use of constraint satisfaction techniques, and the other was based on a probabilistic Bayesian model\u2014 Bayes was the rage at the time. I completed my PhD in MIS in 1989. I finished my MD in 1990 and stayed at Stanford Medical School for my residency in internal medicine. As an intern, I applied to a faculty position in medicine \u201cat the intersection of medical informatics and molecular biology\u201d\u2014this was before the routine use of the term \u201cbioinformatics.\u201d I joined the faculty in 1992, and in 2000 I became Director of the Medical Information Science training program, and my first official act was to rename it Biomedical Informatics (BMI). It was a more expansive name, and the students preferred it. I have been the Director of BMI at Stanford ever since. Research in our program continues to tackle problems in clinical medicine, basic biological discovery, and everything in between. Our graduates have started companies, joined faculties, and helped launch a field of biomedical informatics that now includes biomedical \u201cdata science.\u201d The fun is only beginning. I am most grateful to those mentors in the early 1980s who created the environment that allowed me to enter the field, and start to find my way: Ted Shortliffe, Bruce Buchanan, Oleg Jardetzky, Josh Lederberg, Ed Feigenbaum, and others. I am also grateful to Steve Jobs\u2014whose silly 1984 commercial jolted me sufficiently to change my entire professional trajectory. Current Opinion in Structural Biology, 2001; 11:340-347 ", "Joan S. Ash": "PhD, MLS, MS, MBA Professor & Vice Chair, Department of Medical Informatics & Clinical Epidemiology, School of Medicine, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR My History in Health Informatics Like many in informatics, I had an earlier related career, but instead of medicine, it was health sciences librarianship. I went to grad school at Columbia, which had one of the few programs in the country with a medical library focus. I had been an English major in college but married a med student and discovered there was a great need for trained medical librarians at the time. Halfway through my program, the student protests of 1968, in which I took part, closed down the school for most of spring semester. Though the activities that led to the shut down had been disturbing, they instigated a turning point in my career. I seized the opportunity to get a job that would let me sample my future career and worked at the Medical Library Center (MLC) of New York until classes resumed. A paper based on my MLC project that I wrote for a class my final semester ended up being published in the most prestigious journal in the field a year later, and I was just 23 years old. What fun to see my name in print! By then I was an NLM fellow in a library internship program at UCLA, mentored by Louise Darling, after whom the biomedical library is now named. Though working full time, I soon earned a second master\u2019s degree, this one in health science, because in the medical library field it was advantageous to hold a \u201csubject master\u2019s\u201d in addition to a library degree. My thesis resulted in some very nice publications, including one in the American Journal of Public Health, and I really became hooked on research and publishing. My next library positions were at Yale and the University of Connecticut, where I became an administrator. We moved to Oregon in 1976 when I became Associate Director of one of only two academic health sciences libraries in the Northwest. During the years at U Conn and for 8 years at OHSU I augmented my traditional library work by conducting applied research to learn more about user information needs and by writing grant proposals for NLM funding to provide statewide outreach. I was now enjoying grant writing, since it not only involved writing, but it was also so rewarding to develop and implement the projects\u2014 and get funding. Active in the Medical Library Association, I was selected to be one of the experts in Nina Matheson\u2019s Delphi study that provided the background of the Matheson Cooper report on the future of health sciences libraries done for the IOM. I was therefore well aware of the results and completely thrilled with the report. I am pleased to say that I then played a small role in convincing our Senator Hatfield, through OHSU\u2019s president, of the pressing need for the concept that would end up being called IAIMS, the Integrated Academic (later it stood for Advanced) Information Management System. Thanks to Hatfield\u2019s efforts, national legislative funding for such programs began in the early 1980\u2019s, with OHSU receiving one of the first grants through NLM, plus funding for a building to house the library and all of the information services and information research/informatics units of the university. While our university president did little to move things forward for the next several years, I was sure this IAIMS thing would be big in the future, so I went back to school to get an MBA\u2014I wanted to be ready to help manage the library of the future. Just when I finished my third master\u2019s degree,  Bob Beck was hired to direct Oregon\u2019s IAIMS in 1989, and he soon appointed me as planning and personnel coordinator for the Biomedical Information Communication Center. This was an amazing and unique experience, because we not only built the program but planned a building to embody the concept as well. Bob urged me to (finally) get a PhD and apply for NLM grant funding for support since OHSU did not yet have a pre-doctoral fellowship program. I was awarded the grant and finished my PhD in Systems Science with an organizational behavior emphasis in 1997. I moved directly into a faculty position and soon published several papers based on my dissertation. I began teaching organizational behavior in OHSU\u2019s informatics master\u2019s program. A student team I was mentoring conducted a research project to identify the skills needed in informatics graduates from the point of view of those who hire such graduates, and when \u201cpeople and project management skills\u201d ranked highest on the long list, I developed a project management course as well. These days I am not the only one teaching these courses, but I have always found joy in all aspects of teaching when offered the opportunity. When I joined the faculty in 1997, Bill Hersh, the department chair, counseled that I needed to select a focus for further grant funding. I had the advantage that I was still considered a new investigator, although I had a good deal of experience writing grants from my former library world. One morning, Bill stopped by my office and enthusiastically told me he had just learned that Paul Mongerson, a philanthropist and patient who believed in informatics, wanted to fund us to do a study about POE. Since POE has behavioral implications, he told me, he wondered if I would like to lead the project. I told him I might be interested, depending on what POE was! Of course, it was Physician Order Entry, which was later termed Computerized Provider Order Entry, or CPOE. This was another major turning point in my career, since I have been studying CPOE and its related systems ever since. Bill, Paul Gorman, and I published the results of the study Mongerson funded, and they became the pilot data leading to my first R01 from NLM. After the excitement of getting the grant and gathering together a staff and student help, I decided that a comprehensive literature search was needed to update the Sittig and Stead review that had been published in JAMIA years earlier. We had heard that Dean Sittig himself had moved to Portland and was working at Kaiser, so we invited him to a research team meeting, and he must have enjoyed it because he kept on joining us and subsequently became an indispensible co-investigator for all of POET\u2019s future grants (we had named our team the Provider Order Entry Team). Over the past 15 years, team members and staff have changed, but Dean, Carmit McMullen from Kaiser, and Adam Wright have been consistent and valuable contributors to POET, and I have enjoyed collaborating with their teams as well. Another turning point for me came after we had conducted some of our site visits for the CPOE study. I was attending a Health Information Technology (HIT)-related conference in Heidelberg, Germany. There were about 300 people there, but only three of us attended the breakout group on organizational aspects of HIT: Marc Berg from The Netherlands, Enrico Coiera from Australia, and me. We had plenty of time to chat in a lonely cavernous room that would have held 100 people. It turned out that all three of us had identified similar issues while doing fieldwork in healthcare settings: we were seeing adverse unintended consequences of HIT. We decided to collaborate and subsequently published a now highly cited paper in JAMIA that focused on unintended consequences. In fact, we recently collaborated once again and published an update in the Yearbook of Medical Informatics. Unintended consequences became the focus of POET\u2019s next NLM- funded research project. This then led to several projects about clinical decision support  (CDS), because CDS was causing many of the unintended consequences we were seeing. This also led to our work on HIT safety and, collaborating with Hardeep Singh, we produced the SAFER guides for the ONC. Below are some of the highlights of POET\u2019s work over the years: 1. CPOE. At a time when POE was being touted as the answer to the nation\u2019s patient safety problems, our early research funded by Paul Mongerson documented that only ten percent of U.S. hospitals were using it. To discover why such a valuable tool was being underutilized, the POET team embarked on a series of qualitative studies, developing new methodologies specifically tailored to informatics evaluations. We not only learned that sociotechnical influences well beyond technological issues were paramount, but we were able to describe best practices for implementing CPOE. These best practices publications have been highly cited, and we are told they have guided implementations of clinical systems in hospitals and ambulatory practices, the majority of which now have CPOE. 2. Unintended consequences and Electronic Health Record (EHR) safety. While we were studying CPOE, we were finding that there were numerous unintended consequences of CPOE and of clinical information systems in general that could undermine patient safety efforts. The Ash, Berg, Coiera paper used the term for the first time in the informatics literature, and the work the POET team did after that spurred international efforts to identify, prevent, and mitigate unintended consequences. The Institute of Medicine published its report on health information technology safety in 2011, a report for which my team provided the foundational white paper. 3. Clinical decision support (CDS). As we studied unintended consequences, we discovered that many of them were caused by issues related to clinical decision support. At the time, the term referred primarily to alerts and reminders that were part of locally developed EHR systems and little CDS existed in commercial systems, especially those used in community settings. Therefore, we aimed to study best practices for CDS in community hospitals and ambulatory clinics so that our results could guide future implementations. One finding was that vendors were often blamed for CDS shortcomings by those in clinical sites, so we then embarked on studying the vendor environment as well. The entire POET team was adopted by Blackford Middleton to conduct the qualitative component of the AHRQ Clinical Decision Support Consortium project. We believe our results informed meaningful use requirements for CDS. Most recently, POET led a study about decision support for worker health funded by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the CDC. 4. Methods. Classical ethnographic methods require long periods of time in the field. A movement in the public health arena aimed at rapid assessment was gaining successful results, so the POET team adapted those techniques for use in health informatics. After using the Rapid Assessment Process ourselves for several large projects, we published papers on the methods, and they are now in use by numerous evaluation teams across the country. Along the way, it has been my privilege to serve NLM on both its study section and Board of Scientific Counselors for the Lister Hill Center, and AMIA and the ONC in several capacities. A number of years ago, Dean and I started an oral history project for health informatics because we felt there was a need to capture people\u2019s stories. All of these activities have been a source of cherished collegial friendships that continue to motivate me and my work. Dean and I always ask our interviewees to offer advice to future informaticians. The advice I would offer is to make friends of your colleagues, hone your writing skills, and be ready to move in new directions when unplanned turning points occur in your career path. ", "Marion J. Ball": "Executive Director, Health Informatics, Univ. of Texas, Arlington Prof. Emeritus John Hopkins University School of Nursing IMIA President (1992 \u2013 1995) Reflections on a career in Healthcare Informatics I was asked to contribute to the 50 anniversary IMIA history e-book from a personal point of view. IMIA has played a major role for me throughout my professional life. My very first involvement was working at the University of Kentucky in the early 1960s for the pathologist Dr. M.J. Ball, Ed.D. Wellington P. Steward (Pete), who was a real visionary and innovator. I was fortunate to work with him as we installed the first clinical laboratory system - an IBM 1800 Data Acquisition and Control System. At that time, it was truly a pioneer effort. This \u201chooked\u201d me into the use of computers in healthcare when I was still in my early 20s. My first book was Selecting a Computer System for the Clinical Laboratory published by Charles C. Thomas. In 1986, my husband, Dr. John Ball, Professor of Sociology and Criminology and an expert in the drug abuse field, accepted a position at Temple University where I became the Director of Computing for the Health Sciences Center, propelling me into the use of computers in hospitals. We installed a financial system developed by Lockheed Corporation and selected and implemented a clinical laboratory system. While at Temple, I completed my doctorate and became the author of several children\u2019s books as well as How to Select a Hospital Information System. At that time there was no computing text for the nursing profession, to address this void, my colleague, Dr. Kathryn Hannah and I wrote the first book in the field titled Using Computers in Nursing which launched us eventually into establishing the Springer Series in Healthcare Informatics, now numbering approximately 70+ volumes in the field of health informatics\u2014over 25 volumes of which I have co-edited with my colleagues. One of our most recent volumes published in 2017, co-edited with Dr. Morris Collen, is the History of Medical informatics in the United States, Second Edition. (Getting this volume completed after the death of Dr. Morrie Collen, at age 100, was a team effort by some of the most respected US informaticians who lent their expertise to complete the book). During the past 3 years we also published Health Information Management Systems: Cases, Strategies and Solutions emphasizing inter-professional informatics of specific interest to me. Also recently, the Fourth Editions of Introduction to Nursing Informatics as well as Nursing Informatics, Where Technology and Caring Meet. Each of these volumes, as with all earlier editions, were completely new texts, demonstrating the tremendous growth in nursing and interprofessional informatics. During my tenure at Temple University, I became involved with the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA), just in the process separating from the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP), Technical Committee 4 (TC4) Information Processing in Health Care and Biomedical Research, into  independent IMIA. I attended the first MEDINFO in Stockholm in 1974, at a young age thanks to my father, Dr. Ernst Jokl, who funded me to go and guided me by saying that this field has a great future. In this way I am most indebted to my Dad. I was blessed with parents who guided me in so many ways throughout their lives. Getting involved so early, and with the encouragement of Dr. Donald Lindberg, I accepted the Chairmanship of the IMIA Hospital Information Systems working group, the first working group meeting to be held in Cape Town and Johannesburg, South Africa in 1979. This working group conference proved to be most successful, attended by many international leaders. The book entitled Hospital Information Systems, an international perspective on problems and prospects: edited by Dr. Roger H. Shannon was the proceedings, published by IFIP North Holland Publishing Company. My professional interests continued to concentrate on the nursing profession but began to expand to other health professions. I worked towards building bridges nationally, internationally, and inter-professionally towards promoting health informatics. Our Springer series attests to these efforts in the volumes we solicited for publication. At this time, I became involved with the Society for Computer Medicine (SCM) in the United States, and the Health Information Management Systems Society (HIMSS), which at that time was part of the American Hospital Association. I became President of the Society for Computer Medicine, and during my presidency we merged with SAMS. Dr. Rudy Bickel was the then-President of SAMS. This merger occurred and eventually morphed into AMSI, which then merged with SCAMC, which, eventually became today\u2019s American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA). I have served as a Board Member of AMIA, as well as on the HIMSS Board just as it separated from the American Hospital Association, to become a not-for-profit stand-alone organization. Today it has emerged as one of the largest healthcare professional organizations worldwide. I served twice on the HIMSS Board, once while it was part of the American Hospital Association and again about a decade ago. In 1985, my husband and I were offered positions at the University of Maryland in Baltimore, where I eventually became the Vice President of Information Services for the Health Sciences Center. This led to my involvement with CHIME, which focuses on chief information officers. I became a Board Member of CHIME on two different occasions. Professional organization memberships, have been the most gratifying experience besides my \u201cday job.\u201d I have felt that it is here where I could make the greatest contributions not only nationally but internationally. For over 10 years I served as the AMIA representative to IMIA, as well as serving on the IMIA Board for many years. In 1990, I was elected president of IMIA to serve from 1992 to 1995. I was the first female, first American, and first non-physician president. I had the most fabulous support from national and international colleagues to whom I remain forever grateful particularly, Morrie Collen and Don Lindberg, as well as tremendous help and support from my fellow IMIA board members. We had a successful MEDINFO in Vancouver in 1995, much of the success was due to the Canadian COACH Organization and the efforts of Kathryn Hannah and Steve Huesing. During my presidency, IMIA had several memorable successes. IMIA supported the Mexican Medical Informatics Association with a productive meeting in Guadalajara, in support of IMIA Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). In the Asia- Pacific region, the Asia-Pacific Association for Medical Informatics (APAMI) was formed and held its first inaugural meeting in Singapore in 1994 as a result of the tremendous efforts of Dr. K. C. Lun, without whose initiatives APAMI would not have  been formed. I was honored to be a delegate on behalf of IMIA and joined other IMIA officers, past and present, in participating in this conference. It was the dream of Dr. Shigekoto Kaihara, the pioneering leader of medical informatics in Japan, to have this strong Asian presence in the International Medical Informatics Association. In 1993 during my presidency, the first HELINA (Health Informatics for Africa) conference was held in Ile-Ife, Nigeria, for which IMIA acted as co-sponsor. IMIA was eager to give all the support possible to encourage informatics across Africa, encompassing both Anglophone and Francophone professionals. The IMIA Board provided substantial financial support. HELINA has thrived over the years and is now an active member of the IMIA family. I was extremely fortunate to have excellent advice and guidance throughout my presidency from Hans Peterson, who put together a strategic plan, since we realized that fundamental changes were taking place and that a new infrastructure would need to be st in place to support IMIA\u2019s success in the21 century. From Theory into Practice was our vision, bolstered by the belief that \u201cthere is nothing as powerful as an idea whose time has come.\u201d IMIA has truly emerged as a bridging organization, a term that we formalized during my presidency not only in theory but in practice. I consider my years on the IMIA Board, and serving as its President, as highlights in my career. A short synopsis of my day job career: After starting at the University of Kentucky as a computer programmer and helping implement and install a pathology clinical laboratory syste. Upon the move to Temple University I began my interdisciplinary activities by developing courses in the schools of Nursing and Medical Records. In 1975 I became actively involved with the National Library of Medicine (NLM) when I was invited to serve on the Biomedical Library Review Committee (BLRC). My relationship with the National Library of Medicine spans more than a 30-year period. In 1995 I was most fortunate to become a member of the National Library of Medicine\u2019s Board of Regents as well as a consultant to the Board of Regents until 2015. In 1985, we left Temple and I accepted a position at the University of Maryland where I was asked to help implement the Integrated Advanced Information Management Initiative (IAIMS). The University of Maryland was one of the first four institutions to receive funding from The National Library of Medicine; this fit in so well with my basic belief that technology is only an enabler and that success depends on human factors and collaboration across health professional boundaries. Throughout my entire career, building bridges across boundaries has been more than a theory; it is how I have tried to conduct my entire professional life. At the University of Maryland I helped bring the health sciences library and information services together into a single integrated organizational unit, which resulted in the Medical Library Association honoring me by making me a Fellow in 1996, I also have been honored to hold fellowships in: The American Academy of Nursing (AAN), The American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA), the American College of Medical Informatics (ACMI), The Health Information Management Systems Association (HIMSS), The College of Health Information Management Executives (CHIME) and the International Academy of Health Sciences Informatics (IAHSI). After leaving the University of Maryland in 1996, I joined First Consulting Group (FCG) as Vice President of Clinical Solutions. Here I had the possibility of moving  theory into practice in healthcare institutions, which I continued to do when I joined Health Link also as a consultant. In-between I stepped back into academia at the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing, where I became a full Professor. Upon my retirement from JHU, I was honored by given the title of Professor Emerita. I now work for IBM Research, where I hold the title of Senior Advisor Healthcare Informatics and am a member of the IBM Industry Academy. During the past 14 years with IBM research, I furthered my interest in nursing informatics, continuing to build on national and international aspects of nursing education and training by being a founding member of the TIGER (Technology Informatics Guiding Education Reform) initiative, now under the umbrella of HIMSS, moving into an inter-professional initiative, nationally and internationally. Within the IBM Corporation I work in the Research Division with special emphasis on point-of-care initiatives, exploring aspects of Direct Primary Care, staying active at Johns Hopkins as an affiliate professor in the division of Health Sciences Informatics in the School of Medicine. I am blessed with a tremendous family who haves supported me all these years: my late husband, Dr. John Ball, my son, Dr. Charles Ball, and my daughter, Elizabeth Ball Concordia, and their spouses Dr. Debbie Ball, and Michael Concordia, and my five wonderful grandchildren, Alexis, Mike, and Erica Concordia, and Alex and Ryan Ball. I want to also thank and acknowledge my late parents, Erica and Ernst Jokl, and my brother, Dr. Peter Jokl. All of us benefited so greatly by being welcomed as immigrants into this wonderful country, the United States of America. International Journal of Medical Informatics, 2001; 61:1-10 ", "David W. Bates": "Chief, Division of General Internal Medicine & Primary Care Brigham & Women\u2019s Hospital Medical Director, Clinical & Quality Analysis, Partners Healthcare Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, and Professor of Health Policy & Management, Harvard School of Public Health My career in informatics has been enormously rewarding. I am a general internist and am trained in clinical epidemiology; I never got formal informatics training, so in a way just happened into it. But I got involved in medical informatics because I could see the potential for the electronic health record (EHR) and for clinical decision support to improve care. I was interested in improving quality, safety, D.W. Bates, MD, MSc and efficiency, and most of the tools we had at the time didn\u2019t work all that well. But I was convinced that if we could get providers to write orders electronically, that would give us the opportunity to help them make better decisions. I was unsure whether it made sense for me to get involved with AMIA when I was getting started, since I was a general internist and much of medical informatics seemed quite arcane to me. But many informaticians were extremely welcoming. Reed Gardner of Utah made a major point of encouraging me to invest in the group, and that has been a wonderful investment. At the time, I could not understand why someone like him, whom I viewed as an icon, was willing to deign to spend time on me! The work that I am probably the best known for relates to the evaluation of computer physician order entry. The Harvard Medical Practice Study suggested that drugs were the leading cause of harm in hospitals. It seemed to me that if we checked orders for errors, we would have a chance to prevent many of them. We then went on to do the Adverse Drug Event Prevention study with Lucian Leape and David Cullen, which first showed the magnitude of harm caused by drugs. Later, we showed how big a difference computer order entry makes in improving medication safety\u2014it reduced the overall medication error rate by around 80%. That helped pave the way for organizations across the country to move to computerized prescribing, and today 98% of hospitals are using EHRs, and over 95% of physician offices are using them, with nearly all prescribing being done electronically. Overall, the health IT policy work I\u2019ve done has been some of my most important. The federal government made a huge investment in this area, and through my work with the Health IT policy committee, we helped shape that. When we started with meaningful use, it was essentially a clean sheet of paper\u2014one can argue that the priorities were not exactly what they should have been, but it is clear there has been a sea change in adoption. Much of the informatics work that I have done is related to evaluation of what has worked. But our group has also done a lot of foundational work, especially on clinical decision support and how it should be designed. We have shown that when human factors principles are followed, it is much more likely that the desired results will be achieved. Both having the right knowledge bases and using human factors principles are pivotal in terms of getting good performance. One of the most important papers I have published over the years was the one in JAMIA called \u201cten commandments for effective clinical decision support\u201d (2003). In that paper, we summarized what we had learned over the  years about CDS at the Brigham and which factors appeared the most important. Adam Wright led the work on improving the problem list, which showed that there are ways to look through the data in the electronic health record and predict which important clinical problems patients are most likely to have. We then went on to make suggestions directed to clinicians to add these problems to the problem list, which substantially improved it in the MAPLE trial. I am sometimes asked, how have you gotten so much done? The answer is the team we\u2019ve built. Teddy Roosevelt said, and I\u2019m paraphrasing a bit, \u201cThe best executive is the one who has sense enough to pick good [people] to do what they want done, and self- restraint enough to keep from meddling with them while they do it.\u201d I have a very large and extraordinary team\u2014and together that is what has produced the results we\u2019ve had. Many of them have been part of my group for a very long time, much of their careers. That includes people like Lynn Volk, the associate director of Clinical and Quality Analysis, my Partners IT group, and Patti Dykes, the director of our safety center and the current AMIA board chair. The very best part of working at Brigham & Women\u2019s and Harvard has been the quality of the people who work there. It has been ground-breaking to establish the Center for Patient Safety Research and Practice, and our Clinical and Quality Analysis group has done myriad things to make care better at Partners. I am also exceptionally proud of all the things my mentees have gone on to do\u2014 when I look at all they have accomplished, that is one of the best parts. Just a few of the more accomplished ones include Ashish Jha, who is leading global health for Harvard; Tejal Gandhi, who served as CEO of the National Patient Safety Foundation; Rainu Kaushal, Chair of Health Policy at Cornell; Eric Poon, who is CIO at Duke; and Tom Sequist, who is Chief Quality Officer for Partners. There are others who are around the world, like Takeshi Morimoto, who is the leading healthcare? safety researcher in Japan, and Aziz Sheikh, who leads the informatics center in Edinburgh. I have played many roles in AMIA, all of which have been very rewarding\u2014it is a great organization and my professional home. I served on the board and then served as a board chair while Don Detmer was the CEO. I also served as the AMIA representative to IMIA. I would like to underscore that we are not done yet with the work my research team is doing. We continue to perform many exciting studies and do cutting-edge work that is changing the way care is delivered. As just one example, I think the PROSPECT study, which focused on engaging patients in intensive care but giving them the information they said they wanted and needed, has been transformational and will be viewed as a landmark. We have a collaboration with IBM Watson to both evaluate it and identify new ways for it to improve care. Throughout, the aim of our work has been to improve the safety, the quality, and the value of care. ", "Eta S. Berner": "Professor, Department of Health Services Administration Director, Center for Health Informatics for Patient Safety/Quality The University of Alabama at Birmingham FACMI, FHIMSS, FIAHSI Co-Editor, HIM Section, IMIA Yearbook of Med. Informatics I tell my students, many of whom are looking to change careers and enter the field of informatics, that informatics was actually my third career. When I graduated from the University of Rochester, I initially planned an academic career in psychology with a focus on children\u2019s cognitive development. After obtaining my doctorate from the Harvard Graduate School of Education in Human Development, rather than psychology I wound up in a post- doctoral fellowship in medical education at the University of Washington. Over the next 25 years, I was a faculty member at three different medical schools (University of Illinois, University of Massachusetts, and University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB)), in their medical education units. I taught courses and workshops on student and program evaluation and my research focus was on clinician diagnostic problem solving and decision making. During this time, I had also been a consultant to several medical specialty boards on developing competencies and redesigning their specialty board examinations. In 1997, after eleven years at UAB, I moved to the UAB Department of Health Services Administration in their Health Informatics Program. One of the adages I also tell my students is that \u201cWho you know can get you in the door, but what you know and what you can do will keep you there.\u201d My career in informatics has been shaped and facilitated by many people who \u201cgot me in the door.\u201d C. Michael Brooks, EdD, then Director of the Office of Educational Development at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and a member of NLM\u2019s Biomedical Library Review Committee (BLRC, then BLIRC, and now BILDS) hired me in 1986 as Associate Director of the Office. Dr. Brooks and his colleagues on the BLRC had been discussing that there was a lot of development of diagnostic decision support systems (DDSS) going on, but not very much evaluation of them. When I arrived at UAB, given my background in evaluation and diagnostic problem solving, I was tasked with trying to develop methods to evaluate DDSS. That project began my work in informatics. Working closely with Randolph Miller, MD, I began learning more about clinical decision support and informatics more broadly. I eventually wrote a grant to NLM that many of the leaders of the field including Randy Miller, Ted Shortliffe, Bob Greenes, and Chuck Friedman participated in with me. It was my first grant as PI, and, although I didn\u2019t realize it at the time, it was apparently almost as much money as NLM had in its entire budget for extramural projects! Probably because of the strength of the investigative team, we had a reverse site visit, where the review committee came down to Alabama to meet with us. One of the site reviewers, Robert Centor, MD, had commented that one small part of the grant proposal could probably feasibly be done. Although we did not get that grant, it was Bob Centor\u2019s suggestion that got me started on my informatics research career. I developed that small part of the larger grant into an NLM-funded R01 grant to develop what our team called a \u201cBoard Exam\u201d for DDSS. Beginning with an article in the 1994 New England Journal of Medicine, and for the next  10 years, I and my colleagues had a funded research program centering on the evaluation of DDSS. As a result of my research, in 1996 I was approached by a publisher and asked to write or edit a book on clinical decision support systems. The book was completed, sent to the publisher, galleys proofed, and then, just before it would have been published, the publisher went out of business. I was saved by Marion Ball, EdD, who introduced me to her editors at Springer. They agreed to publish the book, which is now in its third edition. Helmuth Orthner, PhD, joined our program at UAB in December 1998, and almost immediately nominated me for ACMI, where I was honored to be inducted in 1999. In 2006, Paul Mongerson was concerned about why decision support systems were not being routinely used and wanted to fund research in this area. As a result of my research on the use of decision support systems, Mr. Mongerson provided funding for Mark Graber, MD and me to explore the problem of overconfidence in general and specifically in regard to the problem of the lack of widespread use of decision support systems. We assembled a \u201cthink tank\u201d of a small group of individuals interested in the problem of diagnostic errors and convened at Mr. Mongerson\u2019s beautiful home in Naples, Florida. The outcome of that meeting was additional grant funding focused on informatics approaches to reduce diagnostic errors, a 2008 review article in the American Journal of Medicine by Dr. Graber and me, with commentaries by the other participants, as well as the first conference funded by AHRQ on Diagnostic Errors in Medicine. The initial conference was co-sponsored by AMIA in spring 2008, and it has continued on its own as an international conference for the past ten years. That conference led to the founding of the Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine by Mark Graber and others. When the CTSA program began in the mid 2000s, at UAB and nationally I became involved in the informatics activities to support clinical and translational research. This was a new focus for me, but the national CTSA informatics community provided a great deal of collegiality and support. Peter Embi, MD and I initially led some of the informatics education activities within the CTSA Informatics Key Function Committee (IKFC), and I was privileged to serve as IKFC co-chair with Michael Kahn, MD, PhD, and Umberto Tachinardi, MD, MSc from 2010-2012. In some ways the final shift in my informatics activities was actually the integration of all of the activities that preceded it. I had been teaching in UAB\u2019s informatics program since 1997 and had been teaching in AMIA\u2019s 10 x 10 program with UAB since 2006. In 2010 with the passage of the HITECH Act, the US Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT recognized the importance of educating an informatics workforce and funded five universities to develop curricular materials in informatics that could be used to educate that workforce. Collaborating with William Hersh, MD, W. Edward Hammond, PhD, Patricia Abbott, RN, PhD, and Rita Kukafka, PhD, I led UAB\u2019s efforts in this curriculum development and from 2015-2017, collaborated with some of the same people and some new institutions to update the materials. Collectively, the new group of seven institutions, in addition to updating all of the existing materials and developing new materials, provided training for over 9,000 individuals over the course of a year. The curriculum materials have been downloaded by over 10,000 different individuals and my colleagues and I are continuing to use the materials we developed in a variety of degree- granting and continuing education offerings. Throughout my informatics career I have been actively involved with AMIA, as a Board member and on multiple committees. Currently, as a member of the AMIA Accreditation Committee, I contributed to the development of the foundational domains  that will be used by CAHIIM, the US accrediting body for Health Informatics programs, in their new accreditation standards. A final \u201cdoor opener\u201d for me was Meryl Bloomrosen, who asked me to be co-editor with her for the Health Information Management section of the IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics. The involvement with the IMIA yearbook has been a very gratifying part of my professional life. Throughout my informatics career, the individuals mentioned and many others have helped me to make the contributions to the field that I have. Now with my students, I am trying to \u201cpay it forward\u201d and mentor them as they enter their new profession. American Journal of Medicine, 2008; 121:S2-S23  . Bruce Blum My involvement in Medical Informatics lasted only about a decade, but it was a very important decade in the transition of Medical Informatics from demonstrations to practical applications that established a baseline for all that followed. I had graduated from Rutgers in 1951, was drafted into the Army, and on discharge became a graduate student in history. I taught at the college and public-school levels, and finally accepted that I was more suited to mathematics. Upon completing the necessary studies, I joined the Applied Physics Laboratory of Johns Hopkins University (APL). It was 1962, and I was offered two positions: one in operations research and the other in programming. I knew nothing of computers, so I chose the former but was assigned the latter. Fortunately, I was good at programming. The APL computer at the time was an IBM 7090. This was the transistor version of the IBM 709 vacuum tube mainframe computer. It had 64-bit words and a total address space of 32K. Input was punch cards, punch tape, or magnetic tape; the output was printer paper and magnetic tape. To speed the process, a second, smaller computer (the IBM 1410) was used to record the inputs on magnetic tape and print the outputs from magnetic tape. In this way, the mainframe\u2019s slowest interface was the magnetic tape. The computer was housed in its own air-conditioned room with a glass wall so visitors could see the equipment\u2019s size, the console\u2019s blinking lights, and the operators mounting and unmounting magnetic tapes. The 7090 was soon upgraded to a 7094, which had roughly twice the throughput. This was my model of computer when I started as a programmer: punch cards in and paper out with a serial database and no direct access, and that model persisted until the mid-1970s. I developed what were then called Information retrieval (IR) systems. Clearly, such systems had to process a serial database recorded on tape and write data out to other tapes for subsequent sorting or merging. My first effort at APL was a system to process a missile performance database. It would read through the entire database, extract information based on a user-supplied search criteria, organize it, and print the requested forms. After five years, I left APL for a position with a company under contract to NASA. Here I developed two IR systems. The first was for information system of the National Space Science Data Center, and the second was for the Ground Data Handling System for the first of the Landsat satellites. Once these projects were completed, I took a job I didn\u2019t like and finally returned to APL, where I stayed till retirement. This was 1974, and the world of computing had undergone some dramatic changes. In the mid-1960s, IBM started delivery of its System/360 family of computers. The speed of the central processing unit had become so fast relative to the input/output operations that these computers supported time sharing (the parallel operation of independent programs.) Interactive programming was available, but at a relatively high cost. In any event, it was this family of computers that standardized the 8-bit byte, the 32-bit word, byte addressable memory, and new standards for I/O channels and magnetic 9-track tapes.  IBM was also developing disc storage. Although the roots go back to the 1950s, refined products were only introduced in the early 1960s. Some were intended for the 7094, others for IBM\u2019s smaller business-oriented computers, and there was a full family for the System/360 line. To offer a sense of storage capacity, the Winchester, introduced by IBM in 1973 for the System 370, had 30-megabyte removable modules with configurations that could hold up to a maximum of 8 units. In parallel with this, DEC introduced its PDP line of minicomputers in 1970. We favored the PDP-11, because it was relatively inexpensive and it could support the Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System (MUMPS.) This was a programming language/operating system designed specifically for medical applications. It provided interactive programming, required very few computer resources, employed a very efficient hierarchical database, and was adept at dealing with strings of characters and text. MUMPS was the language of COSTAR and many other medical applications. Its user group (MUG) offered one of the primary sources of information about medical applications and emerged as one of the primary groups for the exchange of information about medical computing. The first version that we used was vendor-specific, but in 1972 a new vendor-independent standard MUMPS was published. In time the name evolved to M, and the principle vendor (Intersystem) expanded the M core as a product called Cach\u00e9. This was the available environment when I returned to APL. I was chosen to represent APL in a demonstration project in the Hospital and was given an appointment to the Department of Biological Engineering. Dick Johns, the head of the department, was my mentor. He taught me to be critical and allowed me to pursue my interests. Much of my success I owe to our association. The demonstration worked and was used for a period, but it had very limited goals. A much more ambitious project was in the wings. Johns Hopkins was selected to be one 22 comprehensive cancer centers that supported care, research, and education. A new Oncology Center was being constructed, and the plan was to consolidate all cancer patient care in this facility. Al Owens, head of the Department of Oncology, knew that computers could help in the care and management of cancer patients, and he put together a team, headed by Ray Lenhard, also a physician, to determine what computers could do and how the new Oncology Center could employ them in the routine care of the acutely ill. A well thought- out plan was developed, and in 1975 I was given a second appointment in Oncology to lead the implementation of what became the Oncology Clinical Information System (OCIS.) We spent 1975 discussing what the system should do and how it might work. There was limited experience with automated medical records, so we put together a prototype with an abstract containing the primary demographic and diagnostic information, flow sheets displaying clinical data in time-ordered tables organized by organ system, and plots that showed the impact of chemotherapy on key biological indicators. These reports were circulated among the staff and finally accepted. In 1976, an 84-bed cancer facility was opened, and the prototype was put to use. Because the Oncology Center had no computer, all processing and computation were done at night at the APL facility in rural Maryland and delivered to the Baltimore medical campus each morning. Once we had the users\u2019 confidence in the prototype, we started writing a MUMPS version for the PDP- 11, which was delivered in August 1977, and we had a demonstration Phase I system in December.  Naturally, with one computer we could not offer 24/7 coverage; moreover, access to a terminal was very limited. A second computer was delivered in 1979, and the Phase I system was fully operational. Soon after the system was up, there was a shift to Standard MUMPS, and the vendor-supported versions were no longer viable. Thus, we had a choice: (a) either reprogram the full application or (b) develop a new environment for building MUMPS applications and then reprogram OCIS using that environment. I chose the second path because (a) MUMPS was designed to have very compact programs, which made documentation and maintenance very difficult and (b) MUMPS was so easy to use that many programmers focused on new functionality and delivered incomplete work with few checks for accuracy and completeness. I felt that these problems could be eliminated at the level of the development environment and produced an environment (TEDIUM) that demonstrated it could be done. Both TEDIUM and the Phase II conversion were finished in 1982. TEDIUM later served as a platform for my research in software engineering, and OCIS has celebrated 40 years of use. As an application designer, I was expected to develop a set of programs to meet the needs as they were understood at the time. Naturally, we were constrained by the limits and costs of technology. At the time I started in the mid-1970s, Octo Barnett offered three simple milestones for evaluating the success of a clinical system: Would people use it? Would people pay for it? Would people steal it? Thus, true success required the transfer of a product or some of its ideas to other products with a larger scope or audience. If we wanted people to use OCIS, then it must be offered as an integrated part of patient care, not as a supplemental tool for the more adventurous. Remember, this was before the era of the personal computer. Physicians were not comfortable with computers, and they would use no technology that did not clearly contribute to their primary goal of patient care. Fortunately, the teams that established the criteria for the prototype system recognized that people would not use the system if it was difficult to use. Therefore, they identified a new category of employee, the Clinical Data Coordinator, who would serve as the interface between the information system and the users. In time, the sophistication and ubiquity of the technology removed this barrier. Nevertheless, OCIS was a system; it contained computers and programs, people to help the clinical staff, and workflow integrated tools for most clinical activities. By the early 1980s, OCIS contained functions for use in all medical disciplines: it integrated inpatient and outpatient care, had tools to support clinical decision making, matched platelet donors and patients in a hemapheresis system, established a protocol- directed care planning component, maintained a unit-dose pharmacy system (which would be replaced by a hospital-wide system when it became available), and a variety of administrative tools. We documented the system in A Clinical Information System for Oncology in 1989. The system is still thriving. Farideh Majidi, my successor as Director in 1987 did a wonderful job expanding functionality and modernizing the system interface as a modern clinical information system. She has just celebrated 30 years of leadership. The underlying OCIS patient database remains the same, but there are dramatic differences in the interface and functionality. Now that the field of clinical information systems has matured, it is assumed that OCIS will eventually be integrated with a larger facility-wide system retaining only those features unique to oncology. My responsibility for OCIS came to a natural end soon after the Phase II system was installed, but I continued to be involved with medical informatics through the end of the decade. In the 1970s there were few central sources of information, and it was hard to build on what had already been done (i.e., Barnett\u2019s stealing criterion). Moreover, the half-life of an application was equal to the publication cycle. Therefore, half the systems  were no longer in use by the time a paper came out. What we needed were forums for presentation and exchange. In the narrow MUMPS community, this was the role of its user group, MUG. But for the larger, general audience, there was no equivalent until 1977, when Helly Orthner with Alban Wist organized the first Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care (SCAMC). SCAMC was not a membership organization, but it held annual symposia, and it played a central role in the maturing of medical informatics. I attended the first and all subsequent symposia till I left the field. In 1982, I was selected to be the Program Chair for that meeting. Familiar with much of the work that had been going on for some time, I invited papers that focused on successful systems. Once the symposium was over, I found that the proceedings offered much information that would be useful as a stand-alone reference document. I approached a publisher (Springer-Verlag) and they accepted the idea and launched a Computers and Medicine series. My book, Information Systems for Patient Care, was published in 1984. It was about this time that I left the School of Medicine and returned to the APL Research Center. Morrie Collen\u2019s 1974 Hospital Information Systems was in need of an update, and it was time for a single author book to describe the state of the art. I took advantage of an APL fellowship program that would give an employee support to complete a personal project. I applied and utilized the grant to write Clinical Information Systems. Although the book was published in 1984, I used only illustrations from the 1970s to demonstrate that the ideas were not new and therefore implementers and users should build on what has been done, not just reinvent the wheel. My final contribution to Medical Informatics was the History of Medical Informatics published in 1990 by the ACM Press as part of the History Series. Because I always considered myself a member of the computer science community, I was a long-standing member of ACM, and the origins for this project took form from a chance meeting at a conference with Adele Goldberg, then president of the ACM. She suggested that medical informatics would make an interesting addition to the History Series. I had considerable help in setting up a program committee that identified the pioneers who would offer a broad spectrum of applications, accomplishments, and interests. The meeting was held in the National Library of Medicine. We taped the sessions but never were able to edit them properly; they were included in the historical materials I donated to the Library of Medicine. Karen Duncan did an outstanding job of editing the transcripts to produce an accurate and lucid description of the conference. In addition, everyone at the conference had a good time visiting with old friends. Although I continued in the field of medical informatics, my primary interest was in software engineering\u2014the process of developing systems. The rest of my work at APL centered on this topic, as did my final three books. I retired from APL in 1994. I was fortunate to be given a brief role in a field that is so important in today\u2019s patient care. ", "Olivier Bodenreider": "Senior Scientist Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health I did not grow up with computers. Through medical school in Strasbourg, France, in the 1980\u2019s, computers were far from omnipresent. It took me a summer abroad as a medical student in the oncology department at the H\u00f4tel- Dieu hospital in Quebec City, Canada to have a computer epiphany. The year was 1985. One of my assignments was to review cases of soft tissue sarcomas to analyze their clinical and histological characteristics. Instead of the handful of cases we were expecting, I ended up finding several dozen. This is when my data collection shifted from paper-based to \u201cdatabase.\u201d I was sent to the Research Center across the street and introduced to a dual 5.25-inch floppy disk \u201cIBM PC,\u201d in which someone had used RBASE to create a data entry interface for my project. After I entered all the data, I was taught to use a plotter printer to produce survival curves, and I was offered the services of a programmer to implement the log-rank test (in BASIC). I did not have a clue how all this worked, but I sure was amazed by what computers could do. Back in Strasbourg after this summer of discovery, I was convinced that all this would be great for the next generation, but, as for me, I was too old for that\u2014 after all, I was 24 by then. However, I revisited the thought shortly afterwards, and decided to give it a try anyway. I invested in an Atari ST\u2014a poor man\u2019s Macintosh\u2014on which I taught myself the rudiments of programming with spreadsheet macros. I rapidly used my new skills to help colleagues, who were less computer-literate than I was, re-implement the log-rank test (with iterations in macros) for a study about patients on peritoneal dialysis (whether they remained peritonitis-free or not). Later during my residency, I analyzed toxico-kinetic data to estimate clearances and total amounts ingested during episodes of drug poisoning. At that point, I knew that I knew enough to be dangerous, but not nearly enough to be smart! After getting my MD degree, I decided to go back to school for an intensive one-year course in computer science (1989-90) in Nancy, France. I was the only MD among geologists, chemists, and engineers who, like me, wanted to acquire precious new skills. After a brief stint in a company that was trying to develop an EHR system for dentists, I was recruited as an assistant professor at the local medical school and university hospital. France had just started adopting the Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) system and I rapidly discovered the intricacies of coding discharge summaries with the French translation of ICD9-CM. The French procedure nomenclature at that time was rudimentary and a group of us\u2014including my accomplice, Anita Burgun\u2014set out to create a new one, by decomposing procedures in terms of methods, localization, etc., in reference to standards\u2014namely, concepts from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). At that time, description logics were not the mainstream knowledge representation framework they are now; SNOMED CT did not yet exist, and it was not clear whether GALEN would succeed.  In addition to my work on procedures, I had revisited the analysis of toxico-kinetic data for my PhD in 1993. However, teaching statistics to first-year medical students and organizing the coding of discharge summaries did not leave me much time for research. This is why my boss, Professor Fran\u00e7ois Kohler, suggested I spend a year abroad doing more research. One place of research abroad that I knew about was the National Library of Medicine (NLM). So I wrote to the address at the back of the green binder that was part of the UMLS distribution. Alexa McCray, then Chief of the Cognitive Science Branch of the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications at NLM, kindly invited me to spend a year there. When I arrived with my family in the fall of 1996, the NLM had just embarked on a research and development project to automate MEDLINE indexing. The titles and abstracts of MEDLINE citations could be processed with MetaMap to extract UMLS concepts, but the indexing also required descriptors from the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) vocabulary, not just UMLS concepts, to be assigned to the citations. My project was to create a mapping between UMLS and MeSH for those UMLS concepts for which a MeSH equivalent did not exist. With the guidance of Alexa McCray, Stuart Nelson, and Bill Hole, I devised the \u201crestrict-to-MeSH\u201d algorithm, essentially leveraging hierarchical relations to derive partial mappings for indexing purposes. I immediately loved the research environment at NLM, where a great multi-disciplinary team of colleagues, powerful computing infrastructure, and friendly organizational structure provided fertile ground for interesting ideas to develop. Although my plan had never been to stay beyond this one year, I rapidly suspected that going back to DRGs and teaching descriptive statistics might leave me unsatisfied, and I asked Alexa McCray if I could get a position there. At that time, Congress had also agreed to double the budget of the National Institutes of Health over five years and resources were plentiful, which most likely contributed to my being hired as a contractor and later as a staff scientist. My niche rapidly became ontologies. In the early 2000s, the \u201cO\u201d-word was not used lightly and religious wars were fought over it. Anita Burgun joined me for a year as a visiting scientist and, together, we wrote early papers on the ontological properties of the UMLS Semantic Network, which we presented at an ontology conference in 2001. There ensued years of research, first on what ontologies are, and later on what they are for, in collaboration with many colleagues at NLM and at various academic institutions, including many post-doctoral fellows and summer students over the years. In addition to academic research, NLM also provided me the opportunity to contribute to important projects, such as ClinicalTrials.gov, the registry of clinical trials, and the Value Set Authority Center, the repository of value sets for clinical quality measures used in the Meaningful Use incentive program. Some research activities took rather a production turn; for example, the development of application programming interfaces for RxNorm and other drug information resources, which now receive close to one billion queries each year. At a time when the founding parents of the modern NLM\u2014Don Lindberg, Betsy Humphreys, Alexa McCray, and David Lipman\u2014have retired or moved to different institutions, I feel extremely privileged to have been given the opportunity to work with them, and now under the leadership of Patti Brennan. I also feel grateful to Clem McDonald, who recruited me in 2011 for the position left vacant by Alexa\u2019s departure. In summary, my professional life has been heavily influenced by a series of \u201caccidents,\u201d opportunities, and lucky personal encounters. I am grateful to my bosses for creating such opportunities, to my family for letting me pursue them, and to my colleagues for helping me grow as a researcher. ", "Elizabeth Borycki": "Professor, School of Health Information Science University of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada My interest in computer and the health sciences first emerged in high school, where I learned to program in E. Borycki, RN, PhD, FIAHIS, FACMI, FCAHS Pascal and Fortan and developed an initial interest in biology, human illness and disease. During my undergraduate studies in nursing, I began to see the transformation of health care with the introduction of a computer based, searchable version of Medline (rather than using paper-based library texts). After graduating from Lakehead University, I started work as a nurse in a local hospital that was pilot testing one of the first computer based dietetic systems in the region. I recall how the technology allowed for communication with dieticians and helped to facilitate patient meal planning on surgical and medical units, taking into account surgical and dietetic patient requirements. During graduate nursing studies at the University of Manitoba, I used computers to conduct qualitative and quantitative research in community and geriatric nursing settings. I was an early adopter of new software, interested in using qualitative data analysis software to code data and statistical software packages to analyze large scale data sets. These experiences led to my working on state-of-the-art clinical trials that were focused on evaluating the evidence surrounding disease management programs in the pharmaceutical industry. The work helped me to understand how data could be used to understand the effects of technology on patient outcomes, health status, quality of life, and safety. I became formally interested in health informatics when I began working at a highly digitized hospital in Toronto, Canada. I was a clinical nurse specialist, and I was leading an initiative to implement best-practice guidelines for the management of skin and wound care. As part of this implementation, I had the opportunity to re-design and update components of the electronic health record and decision support system to better support health professionals\u2019 activities. The guideline changes I implemented led to changes in the clinical documentation and decision support tools used in the health care organization where I worked in. These technological changes also led to the development of online educational resources accessible throughout the organization as well as tools that supported nurses\u2019 and other health professionals\u2019 work at point of care. My interest in designing and implementing health information technologies in acute care settings grew. I sought out opportunities to become actively involved in health information technology implementations. I moved into a clinical informatics specialist role, where I had the opportunity to work on implementing and testing health information technologies on a full-time basis. I found the work interesting, challenging and enjoyed learning about and implementing cutting edge technologies that could improve the quality of health care processes and patient care. It was during these two experiences: working as a user of electronic health records and then as a designer/implementer that I became interested in health informatics research surrounding the design and implementation of technologies and their effects on health professionals\u2019 cognitive (i.e. information seeking and decision making) and  workflow processes. In 2001, I decided to pursue doctoral studies in the Department of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation with my supervisor and the department Chair, Dr. Louise Lemieux-Charles, at the University of Toronto, with a research focus on health information technologies and their impact on health professional information seeking behaviours. More specifically, I studied the impact of technology design upon health professional work. This work led to my developing a long-term research focus on patient safety (i.e. Health Information Technology Safety). Shortly, before completing my PhD, I took a faculty position at one of the oldest and largest health informatics schools in Canada\u2014the School of Health Information Science at the University of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Over the past several years I have been involved in teaching, consulting and research at the School of Health Information Science. My research focus intensified as I shifted towards studying and improving the quality and safety of health information technology in 2004. My initial work involved studying how features and functions of health information systems and applications could lead to technology-induced errors. For this research, I received a paper prize at MedInfo 2004 in San Francisco, California. This work extended to the development and extension of several methods that can be used to identify technology- induced errors before, during and after the implementation of health information technologies, including safety heuristics, and clinical simulations. To support researchers in this area around the world and to allow for knowledge exchange, I co-founded (with Dr. Hiroshi Takeda from Japan) a new international working group devoted to healthcare safety through health information technology as part of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) \u2013 the Health Informatics for Patient Safety Working Group. Since then, the group has published several papers on the state of the research and solutions for reducing technology-induced errors. In 2015, I developed and taught the first health informatics graduate course focusing on health information technology quality and safety in Canada. I have also conducted research in the area of health information technology education for health informatics professionals, physicians and nurses. I have published a number of papers on integrating electronic health record competencies into health professional education. In Canada we were able to provide access to physicians, nurses and health informatics students to electronic health records in the home, hospital and classroom. The work extended to participating in the creation and testing of tools that could be used to develop health informatics competences among the health professions. In the late 2000\u2019s, I worked to initiate the development, design and implementation of the first nursing informatics program in Canada at the graduate level. This work led me to become part of the team that developed nursing informatics competencies and educational tools for the Canadian Association of Schools of Nursing. I have worked with physician and health informatics colleagues to develop educational materials for the Association of the Faculties of Medicine, as well as pharmacists to create a toolkit to help hospitals move from paper to electronic medication reconciliation for the Canadian Patient Safety Institute and the Institute of Safe Medication Practices in Canada. More recently, I have been involved in updating and leading curricular changes at the undergraduate and graduate levels at the University of Victoria. In 2007, I was honoured with the opportunity to serve as an Academic Representative for Canada on behalf of COACH\u2014Canada\u2019s Health Informatics Association (2007-2013). I later represented the North American region as Vice President (2010-2013) on the Board of Directors of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA), working closely in this role with David Bates and John Holmes  from the United States. In both these roles, I was fortunate to be able to represent Canada and learn about best practices that could be brought back to Canada and integrated into teaching courses and, from a broader perspective, health informatics curricula. In 2015, I was the Human and Organizational Issues Track Chair for Medinfo 2015 in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. In 2016, I became the co-Scientific Program committee chair for Medinfo 2017 in Hangzhou, China. I was delighted to return to the Board of Directors of IMIA to serve as the Vice President \u2013 Special Projects focusing on international accreditation initiatives. In 2017, I became a founding Fellow of IMIA\u2019s new International Academy of Health Information Sciences, a Fellow of the American Medical Informatics Association, and was voted a one of the top 10 Women in Digital Health by Digital Health Canada (previously COACH). In 2018, I was honoured by the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences for my work in health informatics, and I became a Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research health professional investigator in the area of health information technology safety. Over the past few years, I have learned that health informatics is a complex and rewarding area of study, research and practice. I have learned much from my colleagues from around the world and it has made me very conscious of how we need to grow and nurture the next generation of health informatics academics and researchers. I have appreciated the mentorship I have received along the way from leaders in the field. I have been able to learn from others, and experienced the passion of academics who are each day extending the field of biomedical and health informatics and solve health cares problems with using technology. I hope to continue this work as part of the larger biomedical and health informatics community in the years to come and to continuing educating the next generation of health informatics professionals and researchers! Healthcare Quarterly, 2005; 8:99-105 ", "Patricia Flatley Brennan": "Director, National Library of Medicine, NIH Former Professor, Biomedical Engineering & Nursing, University of Michigan In 1975, two weeks before receiving her Baccalaureate of Science in Nursing, a young student encountered an article by Margo Cook: Changing to an automated information systems: What computers can do for nursing and what they are doing for the lucky few! That emerging nurse is me, Patti Brennan, now the Director of the National Library of Medicine, the largest repository of biomedical knowledge in the world. Let me tell you how I got from there to here and about those who inspired me, led the way, and walked beside me. As a student I was captivated by the challenge of working with people with complex mental illnesses. A clinical rotation in the Delaware State Hospital preceded a semester spent in community mental health. Plans had been well-laid to pursue a career in psychiatric nursing, maybe even become a psych-mental health clinical specialist. At the time, psychiatric nursing was open only to those who had completed at least one year of hospital-based nursing, so I spent a year in a surgical shock-trauma unit. A casual conversation at a party introduced me to a unique and amazing psychiatric care facility modeled on the tenets of the Quakers\u2014there is a bit of health in everyone. I spent three years in inpatient psychiatric nursing practice, not realizing at the time I was following the path of many who would become colleagues in my life-long specialization in nursing informatics\u2014grounding ourselves in interpersonal nursing practice. Nursing is one of many health science professions\u2014its special focus is the diagnosis and treatment of human response to disease, disability, and development. This brief statement covers the entire scope of nursing, from providing well-child care to guiding an elder to a peaceful death, from the rush of intensive care to the quiet being-present as a woman copes with the body change following surgery. We complement the work of our medical colleagues, who focus more on eradicating fundamental pathologies or excising invasive tumors, and our colleagues in the behavioral health arena, who employ pharmacotherapies and therapeutics to aid the suffering of those with mental illness. Nursing\u2019s special focus is important in informatics because it heralds the need to think broadly about the nature of health information, the terms used to index and catalogue the information, and the special workflow challenges of delivering information at the point of care. The 1970\u2019s in the US was an exciting time for mental health care. The promise of deinstitutionalization\u2014moving patients from the confines of mental institutions to live in least-restrictive community settings, providing community-based supports to coach a person back into society\u2014was launched with great hope. I completed a Master\u2019s of Science in Nursing at the University of Pennsylvania, bolstering my clinical training with administration courses from the Wharton School. In the last semester, during a statistics course, I was introduced to discrete event simulation\u2014once again encountering computers and their promise for health care.  Building technology-enhanced nursing practices. The call of computers and those \u2018lucky few\u2019 who were benefiting from them not only persisted but grew\u2014that is where I wanted to be. I explored graduate training in computer in nursing\u2014it seemed so obvious to me that I could use computers to support nurses as they faced complex decisions at the point of care. Simulations that allowed them to create responses to patient scenarios, deliver them, and experience the consequences seemed the perfect mechanism to strengthen nurses\u2019 abilities to handle critical-yet-unanticipated situations. As a new assistant professor in the psychiatric\u2013mental health faculty I pursued the basis of a research program in computerized decision support systems. In 1980, Virginia Saba and Carol Romano invited 500 nurses to a conference at the Clinical Center at the US National Institutes of Health. Imagine the sense that not only were you not alone in your vision, but that there were people who could help you realize it. I walked on to the NIH campus from the Metro stop on a bright sunny summer day, glanced over at the National Library of Medicine buildings, and had this sense of, \u201chow wonderful!\u201d Anyone could walk in here and get questions about health answered. For free. The conference was inspiring, and visiting the NIH campus planted a sense of home that 35 years later would welcome me back. The search for training to support a career in computer applications in nursing was more complicated and frustrating than I anticipated. With the guidance of Joy Calkin, RN, PhD, I met the faculty of Industrial Engineering at the University of Wisconsin- Madison and spent 4 years in PhD Training, grounding myself in computation and decision sciences in preparation as an academic researcher. The support of the National Center for Nursing Research (thank you, Doris Block!) allowed me the freedom of full- time study. The guidance of David Gustafson pushed my thinking beyond professionally- driven health care to considerations of how patients participated as key members of the team. An enthusiastic early welcome from the visionary Dean Joyce Fitzpatrick led to a 10-year engagement at the Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing, Case Western Reserve University. With the encouragement and support of a school of nursing known for research expertise, I launched a career in the design, deployment, and evaluation of computer tools for patient self-management, first at CWRU and later at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. For 30 years, along with my research teams, I conducted research focused on the design, deployment, and evaluation of computer systems for use by patients self- managing in the home. Some of our work used very primitive technologies (WYSE 30 and 110 baud modems) to create electronic support groups among people living with AIDS. In other projects, we engaged patients with clinical and design teams to create mobile devices that would allow them to track health in everyday living and discern how to take action. Collaborations with clinical facilities gave our group the chance to determine what was necessary to make research-discovered interventions operationally feasible. Throughout the process of our work devising technologies to support patient self- management, we focused a great deal on the person-task-technology fit. However, this narrow focus left out the context of self-care\u2014where was the person sitting or standing as they used the device and the information? With the support of the Intel Corporation, we embarked on an intensive study of 50 households in central Wisconsin to better understand the context of personal health information management. We interviewed people in living rooms and at kitchen tables, and took photographs of their refrigerator doors, file cabinets, and shoe boxes full of health information. We learned that people develop very systematic, purposeful, but idiosyncratic ways of managing health  information. We also learned that it\u2019s very difficult to conduct systematic inquiry in people\u2019s homes\u2014these are highly personal spaces, very private, and yet very dynamic\u2014 The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation invited our group to lead a program called Project HealthDesign\u2014an innovative approach to patient-centered designs of health information technologies. Through this program we uncovered a here-to-fore under- addressed concept, \u201cObservations of Daily Living.\u201d ODL, as we called it, appeared to be a language all of its own, used by patients to describe the feelings, sensations, thoughts, and exposures that heralded the need for healthy action. Whether it be the fit of one\u2019s clothes or the ability to sing a song to a child, these observations were the cues that people used to know that things were alright with their health, or if it were time to initiate some action, such as taking a rescue inhaler. We learned that ODLs complemented but did not replace the more professionally-oriented language of signs and symptoms. An opportunity to compete for a new and innovative laboratory environment at the University of Wisconsin-Madison allowed our group to reach into the future of virtual reality. We developed ways to capture full 3-D images of households and then re-display them in a six-sided CAVE \u2013 a Cave Automatic Virtual Environment. Experts in health care, home care, industrial design, systems engineering, and lay people themselves could use the CAVE to explore real households without disturbing the residents, and better understand how the context of home shapes the ways in which people handle health information. Collaboration with another medical informatics specialist helped us locate and apply a recognized taxonomy of household objects, so we could use standardized descriptions of health, health information, and the location where that information was used. Public policy, public action extends the impact of research. Just as information alone does not change health behavior, research alone cannot change health care. Since our team envisioned patient care as a three-legged stool of professional knowledge, personal engagement, and technology, it was necessary to scan the environment and take every opportunity to ensure that public policies kept abreast with emerging technologies. I used opportunities and partnerships to help craft regulations for patient privacy that fostered and assisted the sharing of information. I had the opportunity to sit in on vision- planning and strategy development sessions across the US Department of Health and Human Services. Rather than a distraction, I viewed these opportunities as being central to my research. Participating in professional societies represents an important strategy for public action. In my case, the American Medical Informatics Association provided a professional home for me for over 30 years. It has afforded me close collaboration and energizing dialogue with the various professions represented across the membership of AMIA. It also served as a pathway to engagement on an international level, allowing me to glean perspectives informed by citizens of countries whose laws and health care systems differ remarkably from those in the US. Participating in public policy and taking public action is a form of disseminating our research knowledge. In addition, it ensures that the regulations remain sufficiently permissive as to permit the emergence of new approaches to care. Finally, participating in public policy and taking public action allowed me, as a nurse, to insert the nursing perspective into public discourse. Retiring forward. A long-held dream of retiring and refocusing my energies into local community service was replaced by a re-focusing of my energies into national th service. In August 2016, I became the 4 Director of the National Library of Medicine. As the first nurse and first woman appointed to this position, I build on my experiences  to guide the NLM towards its third century. Through research, public action, and professional identity, I have built a perspective of respect for interdisciplinary thinking, for patient engagement, and for the value of information as an enabler of human health. National Library of Medicine Bethesda, MD, USA ", "James Brinkley": "Professor Emeritus, Structural Informatics Group Departments of Biological Structure Biomedical Informatics, Computer Science University of Washington, Seattle I was born in Oregon and grew up on the West Coast, moving from California to Seattle at age 14. I\u2019ve always been interested in science and engineering, and first discovered computers while working during a high school summer as a file clerk in my grandfather\u2019s insurance office. At Amherst College (1966-70), I was a physics and math major, and while there first learned Fortran on an IBM 1130 using punch cards. My favorite college summer job was working as a programmer for a naval architect in Seattle. One day I spilled all the cards and had to spend most of the night resorting them by hand. I wasn\u2019t unhappy to see punch cards disappear! After college, I entered medical school at the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle (1970-74). Unlike most of my classmates I liked all the basic science classes and didn\u2019t much like clinical medicine. However, in my fourth year, I took Bill Mohler\u2019s \u201cComputers in Clinical Medicine\u201d elective at NIH, which opened my eyes to the possibility of combining computers and medicine\u2014which in 1974 was not talked about much at all, at least not at the UW. In fact, at that time I was able to read or know about most of the papers in the field. Because of my lack of interest in clinical medicine (although I did come away with great respect for those who do like and practice it), I elected not to do a residency on receiving the MD in 1974. Instead I spent 3 years as a postdoctoral fellow in the UW Department of Bioengineering (1974-1977). I was given the task of developing software for creating 3-D organ models from a series of 2-D ultrasound sector scans. Two- dimensional ultrasound had only recently been commercialized (much of it based on work at the UW by Don Baker, Ron Daigle, Bill Moritz, and others), so the 3-D system, which utilized a spark gap\u2013based 3-D locating device attached to the 2-D scanner, was one of the first attempts to move to 3-D. This work rekindled my fascination with computers, to the extent that in 1977, I enrolled in a self-designed interdisciplinary PhD program at Stanford, which I called \u201cMedical Computer Engineering.\u201d Nowadays I likely would have enrolled in a Biomedical Informatics program, but those programs didn\u2019t exist then. Gio Wiederhold (CS) chaired my thesis committee. Other committee members included Tom Binford (CS), Rich Popp (Cardiology), Al Macovski (EE), and Desmond McCallum (OB/Gyn). In my program, I took most of the computer science courses required for the CS PhD, while doing research in the Stanford Department of Ob/Gyn, partially funded by an individual NLM postdoctoral fellowship. My thesis continued the effort from Seattle to develop a 3-D organ modeling system from ultrasound, as applied to cardiac and especially fetal volume determination, the latter for non-invasive in utero estimation of fetal weight. As is still the case, a major bottleneck in creating 3-D organ models is segmentation of the relevant anatomic structures from the images. Ultrasound images are especially  difficult to segment, because organ borders are often fuzzy or missing, so simple region- growing or edge-finding methods don\u2019t work. On the other hand, expert ultrasonographers are very good at extracting organs by using their own knowledge to essentially hallucinate the missing borders. One of the reasons I had gone to Stanford was because of my interest in artificial intelligence and image understanding, which in turn was triggered by neuroscience courses I took in medical school. I thus devoted the later years of my thesis in an attempt to represent in the computer some of the knowledge experts apply to the interpretation of images. From my neuroscience courses I came to the understanding that there is no one place in the brain where knowledge, and particularly knowledge of shape, is stored. Instead, knowledge seems to be the result of the interaction of multiple neurons. Although neural nets, which are currently a popular method for machine learning, had been invented, the hardware was not yet available for them to be complex enough to be useful. Instead, I looked at other ways of representing knowledge using distributed methods, and came upon interacting constraint networks, which had been used in image understanding. Based on these ideas, I developed a method of representing shape using a network of interacting geometric constraints. At any point in time, the constraint network determined a search region in the image, which, when informed by edge information, caused the search region to shrink, thereby reducing the search region for further edges. Following my PhD, I spent 3 years working as a researcher for Bruce Buchanan in the Knowledge Systems Lab (KSL) of the Stanford Computer Science Department (1985-1988). The project, called Protean, was a collaboration between Bruce and Oleg Jardetzty, a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy expert with an interest in using NMR for protein structure determination. Other members of the team included Barbara Hayes-Roth, Russ Altman, Bruce Duncan, Olivier Lichtarge, Craig Cornelius, and Mike Hewett. The problem was to use NMR data to reduce the possible space of 3- D protein conformations, eventually arriving at all structures consistent with the NMR data. Given my earlier thesis work, I formulated the problem as another constraint satisfaction problem, where in this case the search space was protein conformational space rather than image edge search regions. As part of this effort, I designed and helped implement what we called the Geometry System (GS), which was a C program running on a Silicon Graphics computer that was controlled over the network by an AI Blackboard system running on a Lisp machine. One of the more interesting (to me) aspects of the system was that it utilized a distributed \u201cknowledge network,\u201d where each node in the network was the name of a file that could be on a local or remote computer, and each file contained Lisp descriptions of relations to other nodes (files). Too bad I didn\u2019t think to make the filenames Internet addresses. In 1988, I was recruited back to the University of Washington in Seattle by Cornelius Rosse, then chair of the Department of Biological Structure (formerly the Department of Anatomy). I have been on the faculty in Biological Structure ever since, although I am slowly starting to retire. I am also joint in Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education, and adjunct in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). Cornelius and I have worked together for most of this time, and have collaborated with many researchers, both at the UW and elsewhere. I have also taught several courses in Biomedical Informatics, and most of my students have come from Biomedical Informatics or CSE. Because of my involvement in the Stanford KSL, Cornelius originally hired me to develop a knowledge base of anatomy, which would complement the pioneering 3-D organ modeling work originally done by John Prothero and John Sundsten in Biological Structure. Since Cornelius was a long-time teacher of anatomy, the initial and continuing  use of 3-D models and knowledge was for anatomy teaching. However, although I am interested in knowledge bases (now called ontologies), I have always been more interested in designing and building computer systems (hence the \u201cEngineering\u201d in my interdisciplinary PhD degree). And, stemming from my initial interest in the brain in medical school, I am particularly interested in distributed systems, at levels ranging from atoms in a protein, to geometric shapes, to networks of interacting computers. Hence, on arriving at the UW, instead of delving deeply into building an anatomy knowledge base, I designed in 1989 what I called a \u201cDistributed Framework for Knowledge-Based Systems in Anatomy,\u201d in which multiple knowledge sources, data sources, and applications interact over the network to solve particular tasks. The anatomy knowledge base became one component of this system, the \u201csymbolic knowledge base\u201d (later the Foundational Model of Anatomy or FMA \u2013 see below). Other components include a spatial knowledge base (e.g., a shape-based geometric constraint network), a spatial database (e.g., sets of images or 3-D graphical models), a symbolic database (e.g., a relational database containing metadata about images or 3-D models), and various applications that access or populate these information sources. All these components interacted over standard Internet protocols such as TCP/IP. Because these systems were already distributed, it was relatively easy to convert them when the web became popular around 1995. Although distributed systems are now of course the norm with the web, they were not widely used in 1989, and were not at all used for anatomy information management. Around the same time, I coined the term \u201cStructural Informatics\u201d to capture much of the work I had done earlier, with particular emphasis in biology on the fundamental importance of structure as a basis for understanding and especially organization of biomedical information. This importance is one of the main reasons anatomy is (or used to be) one of the first courses taught to medical students, and, along with distributed systems, has been the fundamental driving force in almost all my work since. The group I was hired into was originally called the Computer Graphics group, then the Digital Anatomist group, and in the early 90\u2019s Cornelius and I renamed it the Structural Informatics Group (SIG). We co-directed it until Cornelius\u2019s retirement, after which I took over as sole director. Since the founding of the group, we have been involved in many different projects, generally determined by funding and/or collaboration opportunities, but almost always related in some way to the representation of structure and the use of structure in distributed systems to organize and integrate biomedical information. Most of these projects have resulted in publications, as well as prototype software tools, many of which were developed for student thesis projects. Some of the faculty we have collaborated with, both within and outside the UW, include John Prothero, John Sundsten, Kate Mulligan, Linda Shapiro, Dan Suciu, Dan Dailey, Greg Zick, John Gennari, Dan Cook, Peter Tarczy-Hornoch, George Ojemann, Ken Maravilla, John Clark, Russ Altman, Mark Musen, Daniel Rubin, and Ken Wong. Tools and artifacts resulting from these projects, mostly created by students or staff, include 1) geometric constraint networks for shape-based MRI brain image segmentation (Kevin Hinshaw, Bharath Moyadur, Loyd Meyers); 2) 3-D organ modeling (Jeff Prothero, Andrew Poliakov, Eider Moore, Wilmot Li); 3) the Digital Anatomist web- based interactive atlases for education (John Sundsten, Kate Mulligan, Kraig Eno, Scott Bradley); 4) web-based lab information systems for local and shared data (Rex Jakobovits, Christine Fong, Hao Li, Andrew Poliakov, Xenia Hertzenberg, Alicia Guidry); 5) a Query Integrator for query-based data and knowledge integration (Todd  Detwiler); 6) representation of provenance information in neuroimaging (Nolan Nichols); 7) the Foundational Model of Anatomy or FMA (Cornelius Rosse, Onard Mejino, Todd Detwiler, and many others); 8) various tools for simplifying, browsing, querying, and visualizing the FMA (Gary Yngve, Marianne Shaw, Antoine Puget, Melissa Clarkson); and 9) a web- and ontology-based 3-D anatomy Scene Generator for education (Ben Wong, Evan Albright, Wayne Warren, Trond Nilsen). Of these, the most impactful has undoubtedly been the FMA, which was conceived and initially developed by Cornelius Rosse, is currently curated by Onard Mejino, and is now becoming the primary reference ontology for anatomy. In addition, the success of the FMA has led to several spinoff projects, including our current primary funded project, the Ontology of Craniofacial Development and Malformation (OCDM). I am currently working 50% time, planning to retire completely in 2019 when our OCDM grant ends. Other than managing the OCDM project, I am developing a new SIG website at http://si.washington.edu, which will not only document our current and past projects (and will give more detailed credit than I have room for here), but will also provide more details about the group\u2019s history. And if I or someone else ever gets around to it, projects I am particularly interested in continuing are the FMA, the Query Integrator, and the Scene Generator, potentially contributing to a structure-based \u201cQuery Web\u201d of interacting queries and applications over distributed knowledge and data. One perhaps disappointing outcome of my years in informatics research is that, as far as I know, the field of structural informatics has never expanded much beyond our own group. Part of the reason for this is my own low-key and often non-existent approach to marketing. But a more fundamental reason (and one that has partially kept me from marketing structural informatics) is that, although the term has a nice ring to it, it seems too broad to reflect research in just biomedicine. In fact, in the intervening years the field of Structural Bioinformatics has arisen, which seems more appropriate to biomedicine, although I hope that field, as well as the field of bioinformatics itself, expands beyond the molecular level to include higher-level structures all the way up to organs and the body. In the meantime, it is unclear whether there is a place for a field called structural informatics. There is nothing in the term that implies biomedicine, or even physical structure. Thus, there could potentially be a structural informatics of airplanes, or even music (my emerging retirement interest). However, since almost any field needs to be organized, it may be that structure is so fundamental as to be meaningless. In any case, now that I am nearing retirement and not spending huge amounts of time writing grants, maybe I will think about these issues some more. Or maybe not. Maybe I\u2019ll just play music. Finally, in addition to Cornelius Rosse and others mentioned earlier, there have been many people who have supported and mentored me over the years, including Milt Corn, Dan Masys, and Ted Shortliffe. I want to especially thank Kaz Kulikowski, who not only asked me to write this essay, but has also asked me to write other invited articles, to participate on various leadership committees, and has generally supported and promoted my work over the years. ", "Bruce Buchanan": "Professor Emeritus, Univ. of Pittsburgh; Former Professor of Computer Science, Medicine, and Philosophy; Director, Intelligent Systems, Univ. of Pittsburgh; Former Professor of Computer Science (Research) & Medicine (Courtesy), Stanford Univ.; Past President, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence My life-long involvement in medical informatics was a direct result of taking a chance on a one-year post-doc in areas I knew little about. Ed Feigenbaum had just started the Dendral project with Joshua Lederberg at Stanford. The project subsequently involved Carl Djerassi and a large number of other very B. Buchanan, PhD, NAM, FACMI talented scientists. It also led to the Sumex-AIM collaborative project to be described in the next volume and the development of expert systems. My friendship with Ed started when I was a graduate student in Philosophy at Michigan State and applied for a summer internship at the Rand Corporation for the summer of 1963. The computing group at Rand was clearly taking a chance on me, since the closest claim to programming skill I could make was familiarity with Boolean algebra and mathematical logic. Ed was my primary contact and mentor there, giving me two things to read before we started meeting. The first was the only book in artificial intelligence (AI) at the time, Computers and Thought, which he had co- edited. The second was the IPL-V programming manual. The project I defined was to write a simple generalization learning program, which drew me into AI and convinced me that computers were capable of learning. I also spent a lot of time that summer reading Rand technical reports written by AI pioneers like Newell, Shaw, and Simon. That summer created a sea change in the dissertation I was writing with the title \u201cLogics of Scientific Discovery\u201d\u2014moving from a conceptual analysis to a proposal that the process of discovery could be mechanized. There was no name for the niche I was being drawn to, but it has come to be known as computational philosophy. I was still on a career path to teach Philosophy, however. In 1965, I wrote to Ed asking him for a letter of recommendation for teaching jobs. He had just begun working with Lederberg to use AI for scientific hypothesis formation. His response was totally unexpected: Would I spend a year at Stanford? Taking that chance changed my life. In 1966, we moved to the West Coast. Ed wanted to keep a former Berkeley colleague, the philosopher West Churchman, involved in discussions about the philosophy of science, so I spent half-time in Churchman\u2019s group at UC Berkeley and half-time at the Stanford AI Lab. After two years, I moved to Stanford full time. The hypothesis formation task that Lederberg had suggested to Ed was determining the molecular structure of chemicals from analytic data. Lederberg was designing a NASA mission to search for signs of life on Mars, involving analysis of mass spectral data from soil samples. He had invented an algorithm, called Dendral, that gave every chemical structure a unique name that was itself a representation of the structure. By converting the naming algorithm into a generator of unique names, a computer would have a legal move generator of the same sort that chess-playing programs used to define  a space of all possible moves from any position, and a search tree of all possible move sequences. The overall strategy we developed is known as Plan-Generate-Test: first infer constraints from the data with the same sorts of heuristics that subject matter experts (professional chemists) use, then generate plausible hypotheses (chemical structures) by constraining the legal move generator, and finally test and rank the candidate hypotheses against testable predictions made from the computer\u2019s representation of the subject- matter theory (chemistry). I was able to contribute a rule-based system to Dendral, representing (at the level of atoms and bonds) the behavior of chemicals in a mass spectrometer. By representing these actions as declarative rules written in the language chemists used, we could ask them how they interpreted mass spectra and map their rules quite directly into the computer program. We were also able to write a learning program, which we called Meta-Dendral, that learned mass spectrometry rules for additional classes of chemical compounds. That work was the subject of the first scientific discovery to be published in the refereed scientific literature. Stanford was an electric atmosphere and I stayed there for over twenty years. Working on Dendral put me in daily contact with a host of extremely creative people at the AI Lab and at the Stanford Medical School, where Josh had situated a computer for medical applications, the ACME facility, and later the SUMEX-AIM project. The Dendral project had a long and successful life as told in a set of publications documented and summarized in a short book. In the Dendral years, the National Library of Medicine awarded me a five-year Career Development Award, drawing me further into the world of medicine. When Josh learned that my undergraduate training in mathematics did not include any course in applied statistics, he arranged for me to work with Prof. Luca Cavalli-Sforza to teach biomedical statistics in the Medical School. I continued co-teaching that course with biostatistician William Brown and learned enough statistics to appreciate the power of big data and the necessity of augmenting statistics with domain knowledge when the data are limited or imperfect. One of the applications on the ACME computer was a drug interaction warning system, the brainchild of Dr. Stanley Cohen. Working with the project became another steppingstone in my involvement in clinical medicine, because it put me in frequent contact with Ted Shortliffe, who was a new student in Stanford\u2019s MD/PhD program. Ted convinced me to sponsor a weekly journal club in medical computing so he\u2014 and a surprising number of others\u2014could begin tracking research in the area. Ted was defining his PhD research project with Stan Cohen, and I became an advisor on the AI side. Stan\u2019s idea was that criticizing physicians\u2019 mistakes after the fact was less effective than helping them avoid errors in the first place. So Ted began creating a program that would advise clinicians about appropriate anti-microbial therapy for infections, which grew into the multi-year Mycin project and became a milestone in the rise of expert systems. Our success with Mycin was due in large measure to Ted\u2019s vision, creative energy, and cross-disciplinary insights. After Ted temporarily left Stanford for his clinical training, Stan Cohen, Randy Davis, and I continued the project, which bloomed because of the intellectual contributions of many others who worked on Mycin. We were helped, too, by the rule-based representation we borrowed from Dendral which allowed us to create a knowledge base of nearly independent, modular units of expertise as articulated by Cohen and other physicians.  The multi-faceted Mycin story is told in the book Ted and I edited. Among the lessons we felt we learned are the following. \u2022 Expertise is not mysterious\u2014it can be articulated and represented in forms that are usable by computers \u2022 Representing knowledge in rules facilitates incremental construction of expert systems \u2022 Programs that provide advice on actions of major consequence\u2014as life and death decisions in medicine are\u2014must be able to explain the rationale for their advice \u2022 Uncertainty pervades interesting problems, in both the data and knowledge that are available \u2022 The degree of success of an expert system can be measured against the performance of experts in carefully designed randomized studies During the Mycin years, the Sumex project brought me into contact with pioneering researchers from around the country using AI to investigate problems in medicine, as well as with some of the most talented faculty and students at Stanford one could ever hope to work with. As one of the founding faculty for Stanford\u2019s Department of Medical Informatics, and a research faculty member in Computer Science, I was able to contribute locally as an advisor to a large number of other students interested in AI methods for reasoning in clinical medicine and molecular biology. Post-Mycin, I developed a project with Oleg Jardetzky on the interpretation of the 3-dimenstional structure of proteins from NMR data. With a very talented team we succeeded in demonstrating a program that incrementally resolved the positions of the atoms in a protein, to the resolution warranted by the resolving power of the data. I moved to the University of Pittsburgh in 1988 for reasons of two-career planning and an opportunity for me to help expand a program in medical informatics that included the Internist and Mars projects. I had joint appointments in several departments at Pitt and in Computer Science at Carnegie-Mellon, and could bring computational biology into the medical informatics program. It was an opportunity, too, to work on extracting and processing information from the narrative text in medical records. I greatly admired Josh Lederberg\u2019s sense of responsibility as a scientist to provide reliable information about science to the lay public. Largely because of his influence, I have edited an information portal for the AAAI that collects readable information about AI from credible sources. I formally retired in 2001 but found that I was not very good at retirement, even though we moved to an idyllic island north of Seattle. I continue to edit the information portal, and I\u2019ve recently partnered with Reid Smith, a former student, to form a company that can help organize knowledge for large organizations. I remain convinced that AI has immense potential for assisting biomedical scientists, and others, in the service of humankind. As with any powerful new technology, however, it may also have unintended consequences and be used by individuals or governments for purposes counter to societal values. Perhaps our biggest challenge is to end up on the positive side of the trade-offs, and to that end, we must engage in and encourage open discussion with politicians, journalists, students, and the lay public. ", "Christopher G. Chute": "Bloomberg Distinguished Professor of Health Informatics Professor of Medicine, Public Health, and Nursing Chief Research Information Officer, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Johns Hopkins University I started my college career as an English major at Brown University, though by some quirk of fate, I was C. G. Chute, MD, DrPH admitted with two other colleagues as freshmen pilot- candidates for Brown\u2019s Program in Liberal Arts in Medicine. This meant that I was going to be a doctor, as the program was an eight-year continuum from college through Brown\u2019s Medical School. It also prompted some re-thinking. In 1973, when I arrived there, Brown was perhaps unique among colleges at the time, as it made virtually unlimited access to computing available to all undergraduates. My only earlier exposure to computing had been on a 256-byte programmable calculator, with which I played endlessly during my senior year in high school. At Brown, I took computer calculus as a freshman from Walter Freiberger, who was chair of the Applied Math Department. Brown was famous for senior faculty teaching undergraduates, even freshmen. That department became Computer Science by my junior year. I also took several computer science courses in the main sequence, along with music theory, studio art, religious studies, English (my major), and pre-med courses. Brown was also known for its strong liberal arts tradition and \u201cnew curriculum,\u201d which encouraged student experimentation. I reveled in the opportunity and thrived in that environment. Since computing was so ingrained in the Brown campus, the curriculum, and the way we worked (I am among the few who can say that I have been a daily user of email since 1973, even though those early emails were only intra-campus), it is not surprising that many others at Brown gravitated to medical informatics. Computing was in the water. Jim Cimino was in my freshman hallway, and the \u201cbig kid\u201d sophomore monitor for that hallway was David Lipman, later of NCBI fame. Mark Musen was also a classmate and friend, enrolled in the older seven-year AB/MD program\u2014the basic science biology version as opposed to my longer liberal arts program. Isaac (Zak) Kohane graduated from Brown a few years after we did, with Atul Butte graduating a few years after that. Computing helped support me, since in my freshman year I became one of a few score or so of computer center student consultants who monitored the Brown computing labs and provided user support. By my sophomore year, I was manager of one of those centers (in the Sciences Library) and by my junior year was manager responsible for the entire program across the university. This constituted my work-study, which, together with scholarships and money I had saved in high school, allowed me to graduate with minimal student loan debt. An eight-year program seems like an eternity to an 18-year-old, which, in relative terms, it was. I planned early in my undergraduate program to search for what today would be called a gap year opportunity, since I thought it inadvisable to pop out of Brown after an intense eight-year program of education as an MD, without any life experience outside the Ivy League. I found that ample opportunities abounded, those involving  computer programming in far-off places like Saudi Arabia being quite lucrative. However, in the end, I chose the opportunity that was farthest away and hardest to get to, was the most isolated, and paid the least. I spent 1977-78 teaching high school science in a remote bush school in Rongai, Kenya, about 130 miles northwest of Nairobi. This was at the time that Idi Amin was running amok next door in Uganda. My daily lunch partner was a well-educated native of Kampala and a refugee from that horror; he later died after returning to Uganda during the transitional instability following Amin\u2019s departure. My year in the bush, traveling across East Africa on my two-stroke motorcycle, was by far the most formative and transformational of my life. Among other things, it instilled in me a deep respect for the literally vital importance of public health, as I would witness children dying for sub-standard sanitation or lack of a few pennies\u2019 worth of medicine. When I returned to Brown for medical school, I parlayed this public health interest into formal training. During my four years of medical school, I interlaced my Brown medical education with courses fulfilling the degree requirements for an MPH at Harvard, with a substantial emphasis on statistical computing. I became adept at using UNIX Vi editors in 3-line windows over 300-baud modems from Providence. Within one week in 1982, I graduated from two different schools in two cities. Actually, I skipped my Harvard graduation to get married before going on to an internal medicine residency at Dartmouth. During my medical residency at Dartmouth, there was relatively little computing in health care outside of the clinical pathology laboratory. Bob Beck (now at Fox Chase) was junior faculty there at the time and promoting formal decision support consults, though their practicality was tempered by the requirement to hand-enter all the data. Electronic health records were emerging here and there, and around that time, ironically, Larry Weed\u2019s PROMIS system was winding down across the river in Vermont. Given my public health training, I did most of my computing-related work in epidemiology and population health studies with Bob Greenberg and John Baron\u2014for example, a lung cancer registry project. I was fortunate to have liberal access to Kiewit Computing Center at Dartmouth, where I became something of a UNIX hack, using shell scripts, awk, sed, cut, and join to approximate database functions. I was more fortunate later to have virtually unlimited access to Jack Wennberg\u2019s PDP-10, which ran an early relational database 1032. I was also the first kid on my block to buy my own UNIX machine for home, an AT&T PC7300 running on a 68010 with an associated paged-memory mapping unit, sporting 20MB of disk. It cost more than a good used car, but I could run my own email domain over UUCP, SMTP, and the built-in 1200 baud modem from my home study. Philosophically, I was among colleagues who recognized that much of medicine derived from the apprentice tradition and was based to a disturbingly large degree on folklore and anecdote. The term \u201cevidence-based medicine\u201d was not yet popular, but we all recognized the promise. My personal response was to master more analytic methodology, as I thought that would be the fastest path to an evidence-based future. Thus, I returned to Harvard to complete my doctorate in public health, with emphases on epidemiology and biostatistics. I worked closely with Walter Willett and the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, where I did my thesis. I spent much of my time setting up the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, which is the male analog to Nurses\u2019 Health Study, as its Project Director under Willett, who was PI. I had an inside track to become a nutritional epidemiologist, which is what Walt and his team did well, but this was not getting me closer to that elusive goal of generating evidence for medical practice. I realized I had  more or less mastered the inferential tooling of the time, traditional statistical and emergent machine learning, which were just beginning to recognize their similarities. What I lacked was clinical data for those inferential hoppers. My access to clinical data changed dramatically in 1988, when I left Harvard to become the founding chair of what later became the medical informatics division at Mayo Clinic. I spent nearly 27 years there, happily sating the appetite of inferencing machinery with data, though I quickly learned that the rate-limiting step was no longer data, but the comparability and consistency of clinical data. I was making my pivot into informatics, though I had no formal training in the area. I was probably among the last of the self-trained career informatics folks. Lael Gatewood at the University of Minnesota was incredibly gracious in helping orient me within the informatics community. We co-led an NLM training grant in informatics for 10 years, though oddly never published together. I went to my first SCAMC in the fall of 1988, and there realized the the depth of thinking and large numbers of folks working on health informatics challenges. I concluded, rightly or wrongly, that the core problem bedeviling non-comparability and inconsistencies across clinical data was the terminology problem, where providers and hospitals had little discipline in how they named symptoms, conditions, diagnoses, findings, lab tests, or medications. I have spent the better part of my career trying to address that challenge, through work on terminology development, ontology mapping, harmonizing classifications, building terminology services, and experimenting with statistical concept associations. Stan Huff broadened my understanding that the problem was not just terminology, but that medical concepts and their names had contexts within information models, requiring broader perspectives. This prompted my engagement and energies in the health information technology standards world, which I regard as a logical extension of my earlier focus on terminology. I have opted not to deliver the blow-by-blow achievements or disappointments of my career in informatics, which are reasonably well documented in the literature. I also have not given due credit to all the many outstanding colleagues that have helped shape and advance my thinking and career. My intent, as requested, was to explain how and why I arrived in this field. Today, while still facing many of the challenges that remain persistent for our field, I am joyful to be in a university known for its excellence, and to be working in an environment that values intellectual curiosity, discovery, and research. Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 1996; 3:224-233 ", "James J. Cimino": "Professor of Medicine and Director Informatics Institute, University of Alabama at Birmingham Birmingham, Alabama, USA My introduction to both computer science and biomedicine came as an undergraduate student at Brown University in the mid-1970\u2019s (along with classmates Chris Chute and Mark Musen). Maybe it was the flexible build-your-own curriculum or maybe it was the influence of Dean Barret Hazeltine, who made sure everyone got a free account on the university mainframe\u2014an unheard of benefit at time\u2014but the broad set of courses offered by Andy van Dam\u2019s nascent Computer Science Department, together with courses like Mathematical Models of Physiology and various independent study opportunities, allowed me to explore ways to apply the relatively new field of computer science to the life sciences. I stuck with my original plan to attend medical school, thinking that I would find a way to extend what I learned in college to the medical field. That opportunity didn\u2019t present itself until my fourth year, when I learned that NIH offered an elective in \u201cComputers in Medicine.\u201d Unfortunately, the elective preceptor, Marty Epstein, passed away earlier that year. Fortunately, my repeated pleas for some kind of opportunity reached NIH endocrinologist David Rodbard, who took me in, gave me a computer (this was still the pre-PC era), and turned me loose on the hospital information system. Eventually, I was able to pull data from the Clinical Center\u2019s electronic health record into my computer and graph lab results, vital signs, and medication administration events to produce graphical displays for researchers in what I called the Patient Information Graphics System (yes, it was PIGS). David and I, together with postdoctoral fellow Peter Munson, submitted a paper describing the system to the student paper competition of the Fifth Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care (SCAMC) in 1981. I didn\u2019t make it as a finalist\u2014it turns out I was competing with future leaders Perry Miller (currently at the New Haven Veteran\u2019s Administration Hospital) and David Brailer (who won the competition and later went on to be the first US National Coordinator for Health Information Technology), but the paper was accepted to the regular conference. By the time SCAMC occurred, I was in my internal medicine internship at Saint Vincent\u2019s Hospital in New York\u2019s Greenwich Village. My program director gave me the day off, so the morning of the meeting, after being up all night, I handed off chest compression duty in the ER to someone else, went home to shower, headed to the airport, flew to Washington, DC, and headed to what was then the Washington Sheraton. I got there just in time to hand my slide carousel to the audiovisual technician before my talk. The rest of the day was a blur, but I came away with one thing clear in my mind: I needed to attend this meeting every year afterward (and I have). I had finally found a community of like-minded people who wanted to explore the potential for using information technology to improve the practice of medicine. I was impressed with not  only the brilliance of the presenters but their approachability and willingness to share with a wide-eyed newbie. It was through SCAMC that I learned about the postdoctoral fellowships in informatics, and so, in 1984, I drew up a list of program directors and made sure to talk to each of them when SCAMC came around again. I remember Ted Shortliffe (Stanford University), Larry Weed (University of Vermont), Randy Miller (University of Pittsburgh), and Octo Barnett (Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital). Some invited me for interviews, and in the end, Octo offered me a spot at MGH. The fellowship offered me the opportunity to learn MUMPS, work on DXplain (a diagnostic decision support system), and take computer science courses at Harvard (including a life-changing course in knowledge representation, taught by Jan Komorowski). I also established life-long collaborations with Octo, Bob Greenes, Henry Lowe, Tom Payne, Bill Hersh, Pierre Pincetl, and Peter Elkin. Working on DXplain, and on MGH\u2019s computerized ambulatory record (COSTAR), exposed me to the challenges of controlled terminologies. Tagging along with Octo to NLM, I participated in the initial terminology work that led to the Unified Medical Language system. That led to a series of collaborative projects with Don Lindberg, Betsy Humphreys, Homer Warner, Stan Huff, Mark Tuttle, Stuart Nelson, Randy Miller, Chip Massarie, Perry Miller, Seth Powsner, and many others. As my fellowship drew to a close, Paul Clayton was moving from LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City to Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center (CPMC) in New York. He was looking for informaticians to help him start his Center (later, Department) of Medical (later still, Biomedical) Informatics. I was lucky enough to join him, George Hripcsak, Steve Johnson, Soumitra Sengupta, Bruce Forman, Carol Friedman, and many others to build an Integrated Academic Information Management System (IAIMS) and Clinical Information System (CIS). My task was to create a controlled terminology for representing all the data pulled from various sources into the CIS. My experience with DXplain, COSTAR, UMLS, and knowledge representation led me to propose a knowledge-based terminology (later referred to as an ontology) that included formal structured definitional knowledge. This allowed me to build intelligent terminology management tools to help with creation and maintenance. Called the Medical Entities Dictionary (MED), it became a key component of the CPMC information environment. The MED has been a valuable tool for a variety of clinical information systems and decision support capabilities. For example, the MED\u2019s formal term definitions supported the ability to translate terms from one terminology to another, enabling the Medline Button, the DXplain Button, and, eventually, Web-based infobuttons. My work with the MED attracted the attention of Jean-Raoul Scherrer, the eminent Swiss informatician and chair of the IMIA Working Groups 6 on Codes and Structures. He commissioned me to carry out an informatics literature review on terminology research. This led to a much- cited paper entitled \u201cDesiderata for Controlled Medical Vocabularies in the Twenty-First Century.\u201d The ensuing 20 years involved a progression of research and development, with each project building on others. With the advent of the World Wide Web, new opportunities for clinical information systems presented themselves in the form of WebCIS (the Web version of CIS), PatCIS (the patient portal to WebCIS),[) PalmCIS (a mobile version of WebCIS), and the Infobutton Manager (which allowed dynamic generation of context- relevant links from the other three systems to online knowledge resources). All of these were built with the aforementioned Columbia team, as well as newcomers Ted Shortliffe, Vimla Patel, Sue Bakken, and Andre Kushniruk, plus trainees Qing Zeng, Eneida  Mendonca, Justin Starren, Liz Chen, Rita Kukafka, Yves Lussier, Gai Elhanan, Xinxin Zhu, David Baorto, Leanne Currie, Sarah Collins, Pete Stetson, Larry McKnight, Mureen Allen, Jianbo Lei, and programmer Jianhua Li\u2014many who have gone on to be informatics colleagues. Days at CPMC were fun, as I would encounter challenges in my nd clinical practice on the 2 floor of Vanderbilt Clinical, eat lunch outside with the DBMI th gang and brainstorm solutions, and then go up to the 5 floor of Vanderbilt and develop them. In 2008, an opportunity arose to build a data repository for the 17 NIH institutes and centers that carry out clinical research. I proposed to build one based on the model we had developed at Columbia and the NIH agreed. I moved to Bethesda and took on the title of Chief of the Laboratory for Informatics Development at the NIH Clinical Center. With guidance from Clinical Center Director John Gallin, my Deputy Chief, Elaine Ayres and I then built a team of NIH personnel and contractors to create the Biomedical Translational Research Information System (BTRIS). In a quirk of fate, I found myself once again extracting patient data from the NIH Clinical Center\u2019s EHR to make them more accessible to clinical researchers. A key component has been the Research Entities Dictionary (RED), modeled on the MED and managed by chief ontologist Lyuba Remennik. My work with BTRIS led to many insights into how to address the information needs of clinical researchers. It also exposed to me some of the weaknesses of electronic health records (a main source of data for BTRIS). As I sought a path forward to developing ways to overcome these weaknesses, the University of Alabama at Birmingham was looking to establish a new Informatics Institute. For a variety of reasons, but mostly so I could build a research program that would work on the next generation of EHRs, I accepted the challenge and now I can say, like my fellowship advisor Octo Barnett, that I am \u201cjust a country doc from Alabama.\u201d Throughout my professional career, the National Library of Medicine has been a guiding force, starting with my NLM-sponsored fellowship, involvement in the UMLS, and many other special projects (IAIMS, Biomedical Applications of High-Performance Computing and Communications, Health Applications for the National Information Infrastructure, and the National Heart Attack Alert Program, to name a few of Don Lindberg\u2019s many initiatives). The American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) has also been an important influence, giving me many leadership opportunities. I owe a great deal to the original AMIA Executive Director, Gail Mutnik, and the many Board Members who gave me the chance to chair the Student Paper Competition (allowing me to bestow the Martin Epstein award on several future informatics leaders, such as Lucila th Ohno-Machado) and to be the scientific program chair of what would have been the 20 SCAMC but was renamed the first AMIA Fall Symposium in 1996. It\u2019s been an interesting journey, and it isn\u2019t over yet (I hope!). Every step of the way has been influenced by my mentors (I think I mentioned them all), colleagues, and trainees (sorry for the many people whose names I have left out). It is interesting to me how each project, no matter how small, tedious, or seemingly dead-end has come back to be a building block for the next steps. Most importantly, being a part of the clinical informatics community for over 36 years has been a remarkable privilege that has led to enduring friendships and collaborations, whether working on international standards or singing Danny Boy at some Irish pub. I look forward to continuing to be a part of it as the field continues to advance the goal of improving the health of humankind. ", "William J. Clancey": "Senior Research Scientist, Florida Institute for Human & Machine Cognition Chief Scientist for Human-Centered Computing, Intelligent Systems Division, NASA Ames Research Center Former Senior Research Scientist, Institute for Research on Learning, & Knowledge-Systems Laboratory, Computer Science, Stanford Univ. Applying to Stanford University to be a computer science graduate student as a 21-year-old in 1974, I stated my life\u2019s work surprisingly well: \u201cI can best describe myself as philosophically and artistically sensitive, but practical, systematic and thorough. [\u2026] My motivation lies in a basic fascination with the production of real effects by program-machine systems. By real effects I mean graphic plots, animation, robot navigation, theorem-proving, or even on- line program editing. In contrast to the scientific or numerical programming, this output is symbolically meaningful. [...] We derive our production of Artificial Intelligence effects from an interrelated mathematical-philosophical and scientific framework. The psychological, philosophical, and computational constraints on AI are very much part of my concern.\u201d I possibly first learned about AI from Minsky\u2019s 1966 Scientific American article and a Life article about the SRI Shakey robot. But Dreyfus\u2019s 1972 critical analysis What Computers Can\u2019t Do showed how ideal AI would be: I could combine making things (the flow experience of programming) with philosophy and psychology. I chose Stanford over MIT because California was a dreamland of stunning landscapes, warm climate, a culture of the future. I was looking for adventure. Yet my first term at the Stanford AI Lab was unhappy\u2014I wanted to create voice- commanded robotics but was 40 years too early\u2014state-of-the-art mechanical arms were but prototypes for automobile assembly automation. Then in the fall, Bruce Buchanan and Ted Shortliffe spoke about MYCIN at the AI Lab. Ah! Medicine\u2014the much sought- after relevance desired by a 1960s teenager! The adaptation of Newell and Simon\u2019s production rule framework was captivating, and the natural language explanation system clinched the deal\u2014a program you could converse with about medical problems! Fortunately, the team had a research assistant opening, and my interview with Ed Feigenbaum to join the Heuristic Programming Project went well\u2014I: \u201cI\u2019d like to apply AI by working with professionals.\u201d He: \u201cExactly!\u201d Here was Bruce\u2019s vision too, driving invention in practical \u201cexperiments.\u201d Working on MYCIN was not only making something useful that was interactive, it was confronting reality in empirical work, studying and modeling physicians\u2019 reasoning. My first self-directed effort was studying the certainty factors (CFs) in MYCIN\u2019s rules, numbers that qualified the inferences. Where did they come from? How did we know they were correct? I graphed the CFs for patterns, did a sensitivity analysis, and tried to understand their source and principles. I next worked with Carli Scott on the explanation system, adding capabilities such as, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you conclude X?\u201d; \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ask about Y?\u201d Fairly early on, I discovered a page in Ted Shortliffe\u2019s dissertation titled \u201cEducational Application.\u201d It was obvious that this would be my thesis project. Later in 1975, I met John Seely Brown at BBN who was working on \u201cintelligent tutoring systems\u201d and would become an influential advisor. He asked Bruce and me questions like, \u201cDoes  all that apparatus matter if a few drugs will cover the most common infections?\u201d And yet more provocatively, \u201cWhat about MYCIN\u2019s teleology?\u201d I had no inkling, but philosophical questions were always exciting. Meanwhile, I was sitting in on Randy Davis\u2019s weekly thesis meetings with Bruce Buchanan. I didn\u2019t say anything at all for three months. But I listened, absorbing Randy\u2019s notion of \u201cdomain independence\u201d in developing meta-rules and an interactive model- building system (then called \u201cknowledge acquisition\u201d). Consequently, I developed GUIDON, an instructional system that would work with any set of rules written in MYCIN\u2019s formalism (EMYCIN). I tried to represent a case-method tutoring interaction in rules, but I discovered I also needed a procedural language. I adapted MYCIN\u2019s \u201ctranslatable\u201d syntax to create scripts that I called \u201cdiscourse procedures.\u201d I always felt that not having a medical degree was an advantage, insofar as I might more easily notice what others took for granted and need not be embarrassed to express ignorance. Plainly MYCIN\u2019s rules as stated made no sense without a lot of background knowledge, which I couldn\u2019t presume students would have. I described this knowledge as structure (e.g., disease taxonomy), strategy (e.g., hierarchical search), and support (e.g., causal relations, statistical facts). Structure and strategy were \u201ccompiled\u201d into the rule premises, implicit in ordering; support was simply missing. I believed this to be the most important chapter of my thesis, published in 1983 in Artificial Intelligence as \u201cThe Epistemology of a Rule-Based System: A Framework for Explanation.\u201d It was my first lesson that the best research comes from following your intuition, focusing on what seems interesting and important to you personally. Circa 1977, Bruce Buchanan told me that we needed someone to improve MYCIN\u2019s therapy system. That resulted in a year delay in completing my PhD, but working with Victor Yu, MD, was rewarding\u2014and actually contributed to GUIDON. Reviewing the therapy rule set, I found again that an inference rule formalism was not appropriate for what needed to be represented; it was verbose and implicitly encoded principles of drug combination. Seeking a domain-general approach (Chandrasekaran\u2019s term), I developed a more parsimonious table-driven architecture (a compiler construction method). Antibiotic therapy preferences were represented in an ordered list: \u201cprescribe one first- choice drug (to cover all significant organisms); otherwise choose two first-choice drugs; otherwise one first-choice and one second-choice drug,\u201d etc., ending in \u201cthree third- choice drugs.\u201d Antibiotic candidates were ranked dynamically by locally reported efficacy and a small set of patient-specific rules. Exploiting this system, I then developed a \u201ccritiquing system,\u201d namely allowing an MD (or student) to list what drugs he/she would prescribe and comparing them to what MYCIN would do. For example, \u201cyou chose first- and third-choice drugs A & C; you could have selected B, a second-choice drug, instead of C.\u201d Thus, GUIDON could address therapy selection as well as diagnosis. Immediately after attaining my PhD, I felt freed to \u201cdo what seemed obvious,\u201d shifting from a graduate student\u2019s necessary commitment to understand and adapt what existed to making something new and better. The first project was developing a \u201cdeconstructed MYCIN\u201d\u2014a domain-general framework called NEOMYCIN. To gain the necessary medical knowledge, I presented MYCIN cases to Timothy Beckett, MD, who patiently took me through his own thought process; Reed Letsinger and I mined these transcribed dialogues for patterns of reasoning. NEOMYCIN\u2019s architecture combined a disorder taxonomy with \u201cdiagnostic tasks\u201d composed of meta-rules. Thus, the domain model was structured explicitly and separated from the diagnostic procedure, allowing the teaching and explanation of both \u201cstructure\u201d and \u201cstrategy.\u201d Plus, this framework could be applied to structure models for consultation and teaching in multiple  medical and engineering domains. NEOMYCIN was exploited in a sequence of educational applications with graduate students: GUIDON-WATCH (a graphic interface that elucidates how the strategy rules and domain model interacted), GUIDON- MANAGE (student directs expert system strategically and system carries out domain details), GUIDON-DEBUG (system uses \u201cwhy not?\u201d explanations to explain how it would have to be changed to produce a specified different output). Consulting at Teknowledge, Inc., I worked with Carli Scott and others to develop principles for teaching how to design expert systems. I applied the structure-strategy- support framework to model patterns in different examples, which I characterized as \u201cheuristic classification,\u201d partly inspired by Bruner\u2019s theory of classification. At this point, it was obvious that every expert system was \u201cmodel-based,\u201d and formalists\u2019 distinction between \u201cshallow rule-based\u201d and \u201cdeep model-based\u201d systems was not correct (plus illogical). MYCIN had models of diseases and patients too (how else could it address medical problems?); they were implicit in the ordering of rule clauses and the rule\u2019s assertion. My 1992 article, \u201cModel Construction Operators,\u201d presents a general qualitative system-modeling framework for design, prediction, control, diagnosis, repair, etc. (partly inspired by Harry Pople\u2019s INTERNIST-I). By the late 1980s, it was apparent that MYCIN\u2019s rules weren\u2019t \u201cknowledge\u201d but a model of knowledge (a map, not the territory); knowledge engineers were often formulating models for the first time; and we were developing modeling tools for medical science and practitioners (\u201csystems for experts\u201d). This was a radical reformulation of what we had invented and what we were doing in creating and deploying medical expert systems. Rather than just being scribes \u201ctaking knowledge out of heads,\u201d we were collaborating in basic scientific and engineering research, sometimes representing and modeling patterns, relations, and theories for the first time. On teaming with social scientists at the Institute for Research on Learning 1987\u2013 1997 in ethnographic \u201cwork practice studies\u201d and \u201cwork systems design,\u201d I now viewed human knowledge as conceptual, often non-verbal, and multi-modal; situations as conceptual (both physical and social) and always constructed in conscious experience, not given as input; and tools as augmenting human thinking and collaboration. In short, a better theoretical understanding of the differences between human knowledge and computer models led to a different view of how to build tools and what tools to build. Working with IRL and NYNEX social and computer scientists in 1992, I generalized the NEOMYCIN architecture to develop Brahms, a tool using a multi-agent architecture for simulating work practices. Neomycin\u2019s \u201ctasks\u201d were reformulated as Brahms\u2019 \u201cactivities\u201d; strategy meta-rules became \u201cworkframes\u201d; and the situation-specific model became the beliefs of a simulated person (\u201cagent\u201d). This framework was applied to model practices in a Kaiser-Permanente medical clinic. MYCIN\u2019s rule syntax was adapted again for workframes and \u201cthoughtframes\u201d (inference rules). Now we could model groups, roles, schedules, activities, locations, as well as object behaviors. GUIDON\u2019s discourse procedures could be represented in this framework, too. After moving to IHMC in 1997, I received an appointment at NASA to focus on \u201chuman-centered computing,\u201d in which I sought to apply what I learned at IRL\u2014 inverting the traditional engineering functional approach of Analyze-Automate- Interface-Teach and instead driving designs based on people\u2019s capabilities, needs, and interests. In collaboration with NASA Johnson Space Center robotics engineers, we adapted Brahms to develop a sequence of real-time workflow systems targeted for making astronauts self-sufficient during Mars surface missions. Using spoken commands, people interact with \u201cpersonal agents\u201d that integrate sensors/instruments,  cameras, robots, software (e.g., database/email), displays, and so on, to record and access data, control devices, monitor life support systems, and manage their work. Thus, I finally realized my student vision of what AI could be, though with wireless networking, digital devices, and supercomputers I could not have earlier imagined. The Metabolic Rate Advisor integrated biosensors worn in a pressurized suit with an Excel algorithm and Brahms agents that provided data and generated alerts by interpreting the metabolic model with respect to consumables and a model of workload requirements (e.g., walking uphill, carrying objects). In summary, besides the architectural generalizations and distinctions, a complete methodological shift occurred in going from MYCIN\u2019s consultation mode to voice-commanded \u201cmobile agents\u201d\u2014human-centered computing entailed R&D with partners (participatory design) in the context of use, participant observation (ethnography), iterative prototyping, and field experiments. More recently, I have been working with Nailah Binti, a computer science colleague, to adapt this R&D approach in Malaysia, an effort jump-started by the 2014 Frontiers in Intelligent Medicine conference in Kuala Lumpur, co-organized with my long-term colleagues Ted Shortliffe and Vimla Patel. Our vision includes a sociotechnical study of caring for remote patients with wireless cardiac devices, perhaps eventually applying the \u201cmobile agent\u201d architecture that began as MYCIN over 40 years ago. In the realm of lessons learned beyond architectures, the story of people and working together is most salient. I am especially grateful for Bruce Buchanan\u2019s kindness and gentle style in dealing with my sometimes-unbounded enthusiasm and certainty (my CFs were always 1.0), teaching me research principles I have followed throughout my career. Bruce guided a handful of students in The MYCIN Gang, fostering our individual originality in a coherent research program that was socially relevant and always fun. I learned the same lessons at IRL in partnering with social scientists in projects out in the world and brought this attitude to NASA. There, \u201cpretending to be on Mars\u201d\u2014promoted teamwork with individual responsibility in a shared environment. As for the future, I believe work system tools will emphasize interactive integration of often independently developed and reusable components, like Mobile Agents systems, distributed in time and space. But we need to better understand the nature of human collaboration to properly relate the joint efforts of people and cooperating automated systems; simulation will help. Our theories of conceptualization are primitive, yet understanding the difference between social-neuropsychological processes and computer models is fundamental to tool design and validation. At the least, we should return to MYCIN\u2019s design principle that explanation capability is necessary and must be inherent in a model-building framework, as recently recognized by DARPA\u2019s Explainable AI research program. Application of these ideas in commercial tools has been disappointingly slow; programming is often driven by immediate needs at the detriment of principled design, transparency, and reusability. Why can\u2019t the \u201cagent\u201d in my phone interactively explain or modify the route I\u2019m following using the navigation application? Are designers of wireless medical sensors developing a comprehensive design that enhances self-sufficiency of patients and local caregivers? Following the domain-general design principle, perhaps the best advice for all professionals is to \u201cthink globally\u201d and to make a difference with each project, supporting the dreams of the next generation. ", "Paul D. Clayton": "Former Professor and Chair, Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Professor of Biomedical Informatics, University of Utah After six years of graduate school in the field of Experimental General Relativity at the University of Arizona, I took the only job available in July of 1972. Homer Warner had interviewed me for 10 minutes and I also had a brief visit with Reed Gardner; they hired me for six months (without checking with my graduate school advisor!) with the understanding that if the joint grant with the Mayo clinic was not renewed, I would not have further work. Homer was the principal investigator on the grant to automatically analyze the contractility of the left ventricle of the human heart: videometry. The grant was renewed, and we designed and built our own video digitizer which played the televised image of dye injected into the heart. Using a stop action video disc player (then used mostly for athletic replays), we would sample one column of the image at a time using an analog-to-digital converter and computer programs that could not occupy more than 2 kilobytes. By observing and quantifying the contractility patterns of the heart, the goal was to predict which patients would improve post-bypass graft surgery and to measure subsequent improvement in ventricular function. In other words \u2013 assess the utility of therapy. I enjoyed the work and became more involved in utility assessment in radiology and cardiology. A vital element in our progress was the partnership with practicing clinicians with shared interest in outcomes analysis and information content. To capture information needed to assess pre- and post-treatment status, we needed additional clinical information, so we developed a radiology reporting system and a surgery scheduling system. We attempted to create programs that gave benefit to the care providers (so they would use the application), in return for enabling us to capture clinical information in a computable format. The radiologists wanted the billing information; we wanted to capture the motivations for the exam together with the radiological findings. This approach enabled us to measure how much information the radiological exam contributed to the diagnosis, therapeutic decision, and ultimate outcome (i.e. efficacy). Using decision analysis techniques, we could analyze the probable utilities of coronary artery surgery vs. medical therapy. Of course, that led to challenges in estimating the quality-adjusted life year and the cost benefit of one life year. It also meant we needed mortality/morbidity information. We realized that while we waited for long-term outcomes, the therapeutic approaches were improving more rapidly than the outcome horizons. In 1972, Homer Warner led the department of \u201cBioengineering and Biophysics\u201d located physically at LDS Hospital and housed academically in the engineering department at the University of Utah. A major benefit of the academic appointments was the availability of graduate research assistants. In my case, they were instrumental and productive in building these systems and analyzing the data. In 1974, the Medical school invited us to participate and the department was split: Bioengineering and \u201cMedical Biophysics and Computing\u201d (at the medical school). Those were wonderful times; in  addition to the work of Al Pryor, Scott Evans, Peter Haug, and Reed Gardner on the clinical side, John Morgan developed the original coding systems to convert narrative symptom descriptions and discharge summaries into diagnostic grouping codes, and Mark Skolnick began work on a genetic population registry. From 1972 until 1987, my work was supported entirely by grant income and I continually wondered about what would happen if we weren\u2019t funded. I continue to be grateful to the National Library of Medicine for research support. For six months in 1985, I took my family (eight children and a supportive spouse) to try to install a version of the LDS hospital system at Justus Liebig University hospital in Giessen, Germany. The ultimate prototype operated but was not practical for everyday use. I realized that a truly integrated clinical system requires substantial resources and buy-in from clinicians and institutional leaders. I also realized that the vast amount of clinical expertise invested in the computer-formatted knowledge base would not be practical for every individual institution. In collaboration with Ove Wigertz and Al Pryor, and with the practical insight of George Hripcsak, this experience led to the subsequent (1989) proposal for the establishment of the Arden syntax. As a side note, I had not anticipated the length of time it would take to get back up to speed on the research project I had farmed out as I left Utah. In 1986, a group from Columbia Medical Center/Presbyterian Hospital visited LDS hospital and it was my turn to host them for the day and show off the HELP system. Columbia was one of the original funded applicants for an Integrated Academic Information Management System (IAIMS). The goal of this National Library of Medicine project was to bring the expertise contained in the scientific and clinical literature to the bedside care providers as well as to the patient. In 1987, I somewhat naively accepted the offer to move to New York and to work with Rachel Anderson to apply for a grant to implement an IAIMS system in the Presbyterian Hospital. We imitated the essential architecture envisioned by Homer Warner in 1972 (a coded clinical database; coded vocabulary; useful clinical applications to collect data; and a rules/inference engine to generate alerts, reminders, and suggestions as data were entered or time passed). The time was right for networked workstations and the development of standards (HL-7, UMLS). We had wonderful collaborations with Columbia\u2019s Computer Science department and financial support from the University, the hospital (even in trying circumstances), the NLM grants, and commercial firms (IBM). Of most importance were the people that appeared on the scene. Steve Johnson and Carol Friedman designed a more modern version of an \u201centity, attribute, value\u201d database with acceptable response times; Jim Cimino brought expertise from Octo Barnett and designed a working \u201cMedical entities dictionary\u201d in which a concept could inherit the attributes of multiple classes; Sumitra Sengupta provided the networking, workstation, and privacy capabilities; and George Hripcsak created a modern rules/inference/decision engine (aka event monitor). Robert Sideli created a compelling model of what a working integrated system would look like, and Steven Shea provided insightful and practical strategy for solving political and user issues as well as formulating concise and clear applications for further funding. The model for colleagues\u2014\u201cNice, Bright, and Hardworking\u201d\u2014was epitomized by these individuals. I remain convinced that people skills are the most important consideration in implementing working systems. A new hospital building at Columbia opened in 1991, and an operational system was available just in time and contained most of the envisioned capabilities even though some were still in rudimentary form. The system was used by 95% of the clinicians. Under Jim Cimino\u2019s leadership, we produced an early working version of a web-based application  for entering and reviewing patient data and literature. This success caused me to realize that technology will change over time, but the value of a responsive coded database of clinical data will persist. We added faculty and graduate students and became an Academic department in 1994. In 1998, I returned to Intermountain Healthcare (the parent company of LDS hospital) and worked there until 2005, when I was asked to supervise 50 young Mormon missionaries for three years in Albania. This time the re- engagement process was overwhelming. A lot happens to technology and our field in three years. So my wife and I retired and are attempting to live happily ever after. I have loved interacting with all of my informaticist colleagues through the years. I have never felt competitive with any but have admired their innovation and vision. That has been one of the best aspects of our profession for me. Proceedings of the Annual Symposium on Computer Applications in Health Care, 1989; 116-121 ", "Gregory F. Cooper": "Professor of Biomedical Informatics and of Intelligent Systems, University of Pittsburgh My career in biomedical informatics evolved from an interest in artificial intelligence (AI) while in high school. The high point of that period was designing and building a robotic mouse in 1972 that explored and learned a maze in search of a reward (a small cup on water); if the maze configuration changed, the robot would relearn it by revising its memory, which was based on water droplets deposited on an addressable, rotating metal disk. A local science fair started by Lilla Burns in Brewton, Alabama was a key motivator of those early research explorations. During that period, David Myers kindly taught me how to program an IBM 1800 computer in Fortran using punch cards and gave me my first real job. My biggest fear was crashing this computer late at night, because it drove the operation of an entire paper mill plant; fortunately, this never happened, to my knowledge. Healthcare seemed like a great arena in which to apply AI, so in my final year of high school, I decided to pursue a career at the intersection of these fields. MIT provided outstanding training in computer science, AI, and premedical sciences. My undergraduate research advisor was Peter Szolovits, who introduced me to research in AI in medicine. I have greatly benefited from his wise professional advice ever since. During my undergraduate summers, I worked for Sandy Mesel and David Wirtshcafter as a programmer in the Clinical Information Systems (CIS) group at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, where we developed a system for answering potentially complex, time-oriented queries of a clinical research database. In retrospect, it is clear that the CIS group was well ahead of its time in developing and evaluating systems that (for example) provided family physicians in rural areas with computer-based clinical decision support that allowed them to give expert-level cancer care to their patients locally. For graduate training, I matriculated into the Medical Scientist Training Program at Stanford University to continue studies in AI and biomedical informatics (BMI). I was privileged to work with Bruce Buchanan and Ted Shortliffe, who taught me how to be a scientist. I was Ted\u2019s first Ph.D. student, and the BMI program he started at Stanford was a thrilling place to be, with wonderful people, abundant resources (including the SUMEX-AIM time sharing computer), and exciting ideas constantly in the air. I completed my doctoral dissertation in 1984 entitled \u201cNESTOR: A computer-based medical diagnostic aid that integrates causal and probabilistic knowledge.\u201d It involved developing causal Bayesian networks as a knowledge representation and applying them to perform medical diagnostic inference. Key influences on this work included groundbreaking research by others on the ABEL, CADUCEUS, CASNET, INTERNIST, MYCIN, and PROSPECTOR systems. Upon completing my graduate studies, I was fortunate to work with the Stanford BMI group for four more years, first as a postdoc and then as a research scientist. I mention here only a couple of the numerous projects from this period. One involved developing a Bayesian network version of the INTERNIST-I diagnostic system.  Collaborators included David Heckerman, Max Henrion, Eric Horvitz, Harold Lehmann, Blackford Middleton, and Mike Shwe, who were key members of the so-called \u201cStanford Bayesian Mafia.\u201d Another project involved joint research with Edward Herskovits in which we developed a method for learning Bayesian networks from data\u2014some of the earliest research on learning probabilistic graphical models from data, which subsequently has grown and developed significantly. Much of my own ensuing work grew out of extending and applying this earlier research. In 1990, I accepted a faculty position in BMI at the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt), where I continue to work today. To the extent that my career has had any influence on the field, it is by way of the students and other colleagues with whom I have collaborated at Stanford, Pitt, and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). I am most grateful for the terrific students with whom I have had the pleasure to work on topics that include Bayesian network inference, explanation, and learning; information retrieval; temporal modeling; variable discretization; active learning in experimental design; instance- specific learning; causal modeling and discovery; disease outbreak detection and characterization; medical outlier detection; calibration of probabilities; and learning EMRs. The threads that tie these diverse topics together are the powerful, foundational ideas and methods in AI, BMI, Bayesian modeling and statistics, and machine learning. I have been fortunate to collaborate with exceptional faculty at Pitt, including Randy Miller (now at Vanderbilt University), Bruce Buchanan (after he moved here from Stanford), Charles Friedman (now at the University of Michigan), Michael Becich, Michael Wagner, and many others, as well as faculty at CMU, including Clark Glymour, Peter Spirtes, and Richard Scheines, who were instrumental as partners in launching and developing the ongoing Pitt-CMU Center for Causal Discovery. Funding from the National Institutes of Health, especially the National Library of Medicine, and the National Science Foundation have provided essential support during the past four decades. I am most grateful to these agencies and ultimately to U.S. taxpayers for their support of this and other scientific research for so many years. Machine Learning, 1992; 9:309-347 ", "George Demiris": "PIK (Penn Integrates Knowledge) University Professor School of Nursing & Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine University of Pennsylvania While still in high school in Athens, Greece, I was excited to hear from my brother that he had found a degree program at the University of Heidelberg in Germany that combined biomedicine and computer science into one domain called medical informatics. Unsure of what career path to follow and excited about a discipline that seemed promising in that it combined two fields that were of interest to me, I decided to follow in my brother\u2019s footsteps, since he had already enrolled in the program, and apply. As an undergraduate student I came to realize that this field, while at first glance a highly specific one, actually covered a very broad range of fascinating topics. I had the opportunity to take courses by Dr. Reinhold Haux, a leading authority in the field, who argued convincingly for its importance at the intersection of various disciplines while remaining a discipline in its own right. To prepare for PhD studies in the United States, I looked for programs that more systematically integrated the social sciences with healthcare technologies into the curriculum. The strong links that the Health Informatics program at the University of Minnesota under Dr. Lael Gatewood had with Heidelberg led me to the Minnesota program. Working as teaching assistant for Dr. Gatewood, who as a pioneer in biomedical informatics produced cutting-edge research in various areas including clinical decision making, laboratory information systems, and simulation modeling, I was able to learn about the endless opportunities for this domain to advance biomedicine and health care. Her passion for the field was contagious. Subsequently I started working as a research assistant on a project led by Drs. Stuart Speedie and Stanley Finkelstein, looking into the role of telehealth in the home for patients with chronic conditions. In the mid-90s, it was one of the first experimental studies of home telehealth. This serendipitous opportunity allowed me to work with, and learn from, two great mentors and be part of an innovative initiative throughout all phases of design, implementation, and evaluation of a system that was meant to be used by patients and their families in their homes. The field of consumer health informatics was at the time relatively new, showcasing the many opportunities for exploring informatics systems to directly engage and empower consumers. In the home telehealth project, we were called to address practical, ethical, and technical complexities and build collaborations with researchers in engineering, human-computer interaction, and design. I became very interested in exploring the role of informatics outside the clinical settings, primarily in the home and in the community. I was inspired by the work of Patti Brennan, Sue Bakken, David Gustafson, and many others who introduced projects and frameworks that examined the residential setting and the role of the family caregiver in informatics- enhanced disease management interventions. Given that the majority of our participants in the clinical trial were patients over the age of 65, I started focusing specifically on how informatics can improve the lives of  older adults. Our work and that of others had demonstrated that older adults are not by default technophobes. Our study participants were often eager to embrace new tools if they found them to be useful and easy to use. While there was a growing market of wellness and health monitoring tools specifically for older adults at the time, many hardware and software vendors failed to actually engage older adults in the design of these systems, and even worse, they often didn't even include them in the testing phase. I became convinced that informatics systems when designed appropriately, and based on engagement of the end users in all stages, can help us facilitate a shift from institution- centric to patient-centric approaches to health care delivery. This shift includes providing access to tailored information, meaningfully engaging patients and families, and facilitating shared decision-making. At the same time, new challenges are introduced, such as consumers\u2019 digital literacy, ensuring their ongoing informed consent, and maintaining their independence and autonomy. My first academic position was at the University of Missouri. Once again, I found myself surrounded by inspiring mentors. Dr. Joyce Mitchell, who was at that time at the University of Missouri, showed me the importance of informatics research that is applied and translates into practice, and the value of building interdisciplinary teams and reaching out to numerous units on campus to tackle complex problems with the benefit of applying the tools and theories of different disciplines. For my own research agenda, I joined Dr. Marilyn Rantz\u2019s team in the School of Nursing to explore smart home research at TigerPlace, a retirement community that was and continues to be unique in the country and perhaps the world as a living research laboratory and \u201csmart\u201d community demonstrating the principles of aging in place. Dr. Rantz demonstrated the value of participatory research and ways to respectfully and meaningfully engage older adults, their families, and community representatives in the formulation of one\u2019s research agenda. I also partnered with Dr. Debra Parker Oliver to form the Hospice Caregiving Research Network, an initiative with the mission to utilize informatics to support family caregivers of patients at the end of life. This work has continued and expanded over the years to include various clinical trials examining video-tools, social media, and other technologies to facilitate shared decision making in hospice. In 2006, I joined the University of Washington and formed the HEALTH-E (Home- based Environmental and Assisted Living Technologies for Healthy Elders) initiative. We have been exploring both smart home sensing technologies and active monitoring tools such as wearables or patient portals to explore how they can support aging and independence. I have seen the value of interdisciplinary collaboration in my own research and am a strong believer that team science and commitment to innovation should also be integrated formally into training the next generation of scientists. I was able to establish a new Training Program in Aging and Informatics in the School of Nursing funded by the NIH National Institute for Nursing Research at the University of Washington while also directing our NIH National Library of Medicine Training Program in Biomedical and Health Informatics. Both programs provide funding for pre- and postdoctoral trainees to prepare the next generation of informatics scientists, and both curricular offerings rely on the benefits of team science and active partnerships with end users, researchers, and the industry. With the proliferation of computing technologies in all aspects of our lives, consumer health informatics has experienced a significant growth. At the same time, the challenges of privacy, confidentiality, and data security remain. We are now called upon to explore how patient-generated data can effectively be integrated into clinical information systems, and in this context, how we can address challenges of information overload, accountability, liability, and also the accuracy and  validity of these new data sets. We aim for more holistic, continuous, and proactive monitoring of patients and health consumers, capturing not only the biological and physiological aspects of well-being, but also the environmental, genetic, behavioral, and social ones. Consumer informatics is paving the way for an exciting future for health care, and I have had the fortune of inspirational mentors, collaborators, and trainees who made being part of this trajectory a truly rewarding experience. Medical Informatics and the Internet in Medicine, 2004; 44:87-94 ", "Dina Demner-Fushman": "MD, PhD, ACMI Fellow, Investigator, Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, National Library of Medicine, NIH My journey to Medical Informatics Chance or fate or luck brought my family to New York in 1994 for two years of my husband\u2019s postdoctoral fellowship at the Rockefeller University. I quickly found out that I was not allowed to practice medicine without going back to school. When two years turned into five and it became clear that we\u2019d found a new home in the US, I started looking for ways to get back to my profession. The prerequisites to getting into a medical school included taking an introductory English course at any college. I enrolled in Hunter College and signed up for an introductory computer science course along with the required English course. Computer science turned out to be as appealing and fun as medicine, and I decided to build a new career by first getting my bachelor\u2019s degree in CS from Hunter College and then enrolling in the graduate CS program at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP). Another lucky chance brought NIH recruiters to the CS department in my first year of graduate school. I applied and was invited for a summer internship with the Communication Engineering Branch at the Lister Hill Center in 2002. I never left. That summer, I unknowingly joined the ranks of medical informatics. My preceptor was Susan Hauser, a certified engineer with a daring vision of people accessing PubMed on their handheld devices, which at the time had no browsers and no ability to connect to PubMed. I still remember how scary it was to present our first prototype to Alexa McCray at the end of the summer. It probably wasn\u2019t a complete disaster, as I was invited to stay as student employee and continue developing PubMed on Tap, our server / light client (app in today\u2019s language) architecture for enabling PubMed searches on Palm Pilots and Windows CE devices. The same summer of 2002, my UMCP advisor Doug Oard sent me Bill Hersh\u2019s call for proposals for genomics pre-track at the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC). My advisor\u2019s lab was actively involved in other TREC evaluations, which encouraged me to think about the information needs of clinicians and biomedical researchers, and use cases for formal evaluations of the methods developed to support their daily activities by delivering pertinent information needed at the point of service. Participating for its full duration in what started as pre-track and became TREC Genomics Track, as well as being at NLM and working on improving access to NLM resources, inspired me to rethink my UMCP research proposal and focus on developing approaches to automatic answering of clinical questions. PubMed on Tap gave us an opportunity to research just-in-time delivery of relevant information and resulted in our first JAMIA publication. A framework and a system for answering clinical questions came to fruition in 2007 and still serve as foundation for delivery of bottom-line advice. In 2004, I was extremely lucky to attend my very first AMIA/Medinfo in San Francisco. The feeling of finding a community of people like me was overwhelming.  This conference opened my eyes to medical informatics and the NLM\u2019s role in it. I knew immediately that this is my community and this is where I belong, while continuing to maintain connections with the communities involved in open domain Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing. In 2007, another lucky coincidence placed our poster presenting PubMed on Tap at the NIH research festival next to an NIH Clinical Center poster presented by Charlotte Seckman and Cheryl Fisher, whose poster discussed the problems they encountered processing the free-form text fields in the interdisciplinary teams\u2019 progress notes. Their task was to support care plan development with personalized evidence-based information included into the team\u2019s workflow. Information had to be relevant to the patient\u2019s current problems captured in the notes. This providential poster placement resulted in a system that supports interdisciplinary teams at the NIH Clinical Center. Working with the text of the notes encouraged me to study processing of clinical text and what clinical tasks a functioning NLP system could support, and it reinforced my belief in question answering (QA) as a practical approach to address clinicians\u2019 information needs. My work in question answering gave me an incredible opportunity to lead a project initiated by Dr. Don Lindberg shortly after [IBM machine] Watson\u2019s success on Jeopardy [in 2011]. Dr. Lindberg envisioned supporting NLM customer services with a system capable of answering consumer heath questions. Both our system and the team building the system benefited tremendously from Dr. Lindberg\u2019s, Dr. Corn\u2019s, and Betsy Humphreys\u2019s insights and support, to say nothing about being exposed to the founders of our field and sometimes getting a lesson in the history of medical informatics from those who made it. Being a researcher at the Lister Hill Center gave me an unparalleled opportunity to interact with the stars of medical informatics serving on our Board of Scientific Counselors and actively contribute to several projects that advance both medical informatics research and practical applications. Looking back, I am glad I had the guts to seize the opportunities that were presented to me and the background to take advantage of them. While the stars aligned, I feel the hard work and my willingness to take big risks ultimately shaped my career in medical informatics. Sometimes I am asked what my dream job would be, and I feel extremely fortunate when I honestly answer that I have my dream job. I love my job and my communities and hope to continue contributing to the field. ", "Don Eugene Detmer": "FACMI, FACS, FACSP (Emerit.), FAACN (Hon.), FAAPA (Hon.) Professor of Health Policy Emeritus, Vice-President & Provost for Health Sciences Emeritus, Professor of Medical Education, School of Medicine, University of Virginia My introductions to computing and informatics consisted of data analysis while at the Heart Surgery Branch of the National Institutes of Health in 1967-69 D.E. Detmer, MD, MA using a IBM 360 with punch cards, multiple visits to the National Library of Medicine, and site visits to Morrie Collen\u2019s Multiphasic Screening Unit in 1969 and Larry Weed\u2019s PROMIS Laboratory at the University of Vermont in 1971. While at Duke as a surgical resident from 1969-73, I redesigned the medical record used by the General and Thoracic Surgical Services that had not be changed since the Duke Medical Center opened in 1930. Also, I developed a pre-operative checklist the evening prior to surgical operations to assure quality and efficiency the next day. When I joined the faculties of the departments of surgery and preventive medicine at the University of Wisconsin- Madison in 1973, I also sought out a conversation with Warner Slack. At Wisconsin from 1973-84, I used computers to analyze area-wide variations in surgical procedures rates as director of research for the regional Professional Standards Review Organization. I also track my clinical outcome data on sports medicine patients with Chronic Compartment Syndrome. I reflected the influence from Weed by \u201cSOAPing\u201d my clinical notes. Also at that time, I developed the nation\u2019s first master\u2019s degree program for preparing clinician-executives which included courses on decision support and systems thinking, taught by Dennis Fryback and David Gustafson, both of whom became lifelong friends. The Administrative Medicine Program ran from the mid- 1970s to 2000 at UW-Madison. Courses in the program included other topics important to clinical informatics such as organizational behavior and strategic management. At the same time, in the Department of Surgery, I ran the Vascular Laboratory, co-directed the Peripheral Vascular Service, and for a decade was the general surgeon for the Wisconsin Badger Varsity Teams. Looking back, my interest in informatics had its origins when I was selected to attend a Science and Mathematics Camp at the University of Kansas in 1954. While there I caught a catfish in Potter\u2019s Lake in the center of the campus. I noted that it had a bifurcation of two of its barbels and presented this finding at the annual meeting of the State Academy of Science. Later speculation while a KU student as to the cause of this malformation attributed it to the combined effect of hair spray and latex since the lake side was a site for late night rendezvous. The Camp led to summer jobs in the Physiology Department under the direction of Drs. William Balfour and Frederick Samson. They taught me the importance of keeping good data and neither understating nor overstating the findings. This discipline with respect to the research for new insights clearly set the stage for a greater interest in information and its proper uses. My first national presentation was to the Society for Cell Biology annual meeting in Chicago when I was a first-year medical student at the University of Kansas. With Nobelists Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, Peter Mitchell, and George  Palade in the audience that day, all future scientific presentations were somewhat anticlimactic. Charles Lewis, a professor at the Kansas University School of Medicine got me interested in denominator data and the power of data to influence public health. Drs. Jack Zimmerman and Tom King, also at KUMC, furthered my interest in research and the importance of clean data by supporting me to pursue my own research question during a medical school summer break, and Dr. James Isaacs at Hopkins showed me the ropes during summer research breaks there. Doing standard deviations on one\u2019s data in those days left you hungry for better technology. By 1984, I was recruited to the University of Utah to become Professor of Medical Informatics, Professor of Surgery, and Vice-President for Health Sciences (VPHS). As a member of the Medical Informatics Department, I became friends with Homer Warner, Reed Gardner, Al Pryor, Paul Clayton, and many others. As VPHS, I supported Homer Warner and Dean Samuelson of the School of Medicine in the renaming of the Department of Medical Biophysics and Computing to become the nation\u2019s first Department of Medical Informatics. Homer Warner was also convinced to move his laboratory to the Medical School site. Priscilla Mayden retired as director of the Eccles Health Sciences Library, and I appointed Wayne J. Peay as her successor. Suzanne Stensaas was granted seed funding from my office for her \u201cSlice of Life\u201d histology collection for medical education. Donald A. B. Lindberg gave a lecture at the University in either 1986 or 1987, and soon thereafter I was invited to join the Board of Regents of the National Library of Medicine. I later became its Chairman (1989-91). As a result of this appointment, my abiding long-term interest became national and international health information policy to support care, research, education, and population health. Around that same time, the Institute of Medicine asked me to chair a study on the future of the medical record. Enrique (Queta) Bond was on the Board of Regents of the NLM and was also prominent in the Institute of Medicine. An NLM conference led her and Don Lindberg to believe that an IOM study on the electronic health record (EHR) was needed. It took many months to get sufficient financing to support the study. Among those who helped a great deal were Paul Tang, who worked for HP at that time, as well as Ted Shortliffe. In 1989, the study got underway and ultimately engaged around 150 people across the country looking at three sets of issues, i.e., policy and organization, technology, and implementation. Don Berwick and Carmi Margolis led the first team, Morrie Collen and Marion Ball led the second, and Ted Shortliffe and Paul Tang headed the third group. When the committee was being formed, Larry Weed was approached to be on the Study Committee. He believed that no study was needed, since he\u2019d already written what needed to be done. In his stead, Dr. Harold Cross, a family medicine physician and close colleague of Dr. Weed, was coaxed to join the group. Prior to the release of the report, Dr. Cross resigned in good spirits since he felt it wasn\u2019t sufficiently in synchrony with Larry Weed\u2019s vision for the future. Very soon after the release of the study, Dr. Nicholas Davies, an internist from Atlanta and cheerful contributing member of the study committee, was killed along with Senator Tower in a plane crash off the coast of Georgia. Some months later, the Computer-Based Patient Record Institute envisioned by the study originated the Nick Davies Award for excellence in EHR system implementation. Eventually, this award was taken over by HIMSS. The IOM reports issued in 1991 and 1997, entitled The Computer-based Patient Record, were described by the Economist magazine years later in a tribute to Larry Weed as having been responsible for changing the concept of EHRs from a vision of a group of idealists into an establishment goal. Ultimately, this resulted in the HITECH  provisions of the Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. During a meeting with Congressman Stennie Hoyer of Maryland the prior year, a few HICT policy wonks met with the House Minority Leader at his invitation to discuss EHRs since he had heard of them but didn\u2019t know much more than that. When introducing ourselves, I mentioned that I\u2019d worked on the topic for over 20 years. His immediate comment was, \u201cYou\u2019ve not been very effective, have you?\u201d My immediate retort was, \u201cThat\u2019s true, but today will be the day.\u201d At the end of the hour, he stated that he had been convinced that EHRs were what America\u2019s healthcare system needed. My parting comment was, \u201cSee, I told you that today would be the day!\u201d As they say, the rest is history. The idealists involved in the IOM 1991 study and its update in 1997 engaged a number of ACMI and AMIA leaders, and the study\u2019s engagement of a Who\u2019s Who of the nation\u2019s informaticians assured widespread dissemination of the Report. The CPR Institute similarly increased the visibility and diffusion of the \u2018dream\u2019 of a nation with EHRs as an infrastructural necessity. From 1994-2002, I chaired the Board on Health Care Services of the Institute of Medicine. That Board considered all aspects of the health care delivery system. In the latter role, I served as the Board Liaison to the To Err is Human (2000) and Crossing the Quality Chasm (2001) Reports. The Chasm report spoke directly to the need for electronic health records and a health information infrastructure as essential to dramatically influence health care quality and safety. Dr. David Lawrence, then head of the Kaiser System was a strong advocate for EHRs as part of the future infrastructure for improving quality and safety. From 1996-99, I served as the chair of the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics, I created and chaired the National Health Information Infrastructure subcommittee which refined the IOM CPR Report\u2019s vision into a more detailed version that lead eventually to the HITECH Act, as well as supporting what become the Office of the National Coordinator. During that period, I was also engaged with Secretary Donna Shalala and Dr. John Eisenberg, Director of AHRQ, in adjudicating the original HIPAA regulations. Unfortunately, Dr. Eisenberg tilted the final regulations too much toward the civil rights lawyers\u2019 privacy side. Instrumental in convincing Sen. Bennett (Utah) to create what became S.1330, a bill that would have been far preferable to HIPAA, the Senate HELP Committee failed to move the bill forward, and as a result the USA inherited HIPAA. Most recently with respect to HIPAA 2013-16, I worked with the Chief of Staff of the Energy and Commerce Committee along with others to create reform language to allow personal health information to be used for data research. This st language become part of H.R.5, the 21 Century Cures Bill. At the time of this writing, this language didn\u2019t clear the Conference Committee with the Senate. Since it didn\u2019t succeed this time, I\u2019ll need to start all over in 2017. Being able to use PHI for data hypothesis generation research would be of enormous benefit to data analytics for improving quality, safety, access, and equity of care. From 1999 to 2004, I held the Dennis Gillings Professorship for Health Management at the Judge Business School at the University of Cambridge. While at Cambridge, we were contracted to perform a comprehensive assessment of the government of England and Wales\u2019s strategic vision for implementing EHR systems. My report was submitted to Dame Gisela Stuart, then Under Secretary of Health for Parliament. During those same years, I was a consultant to the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong to help them create their health information infrastructure. Further, with financial support from J&J through the efforts of Dr. Scott Ratzan, policy work was done with colleagues across Europe to  improve patient access to health records and patient decision making. Those two reports are available upon request from me. Throughout this period, I served on a number of IOM studies relating to health information and IT infrastructures, including membership on President Bush\u2019s Commission on Systemic Interoperability. I also served on NIH panels evaluating CTSA grants as well as National Advisory Committees for several universities having CTSA awards. A listing is available on request. In 2005, I became the first President and CEO of AMIA, where I was blessed with both an excellent, highly motivated staff combined with energetic, capable Board members. Notable activities that moved forward during that five-year tenure included creating in collaboration with Charles Safran and William Hersh the AMIA 10x10 education program. The Academic Forum was conceived and began to serve as the point of reference for all issues relating to creating and managing first-rate academic programs in informatics. An annual Summit to share progress in Translational and Research Informatics to be held in San Francisco was begun. An annual invitational health policy conference was also created to assure interaction between the executive and legislative branches with AMIA/ACMI experts on an ongoing basis. Perhaps the most major shift that occurred during this time was the effort to focus not on information technology but on informatics. Crucial to this conceptual shift was critical language in an IOM report, Health Professions Education: A Bridge to Quality (2003). For the first time, competence in informatics was identified as one of five core competencies for all future health professionals. As such, the Board under Paul Tang\u2019s leadership made AMIA\u2019s \u2018hedgehog\u2019 the professional home for all such professionals. A million-dollar grant was obtained from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to improve professional informatics education internationally. This resulted in two retreats at the Rockefeller Foundation Conference Center in Bellagio, Italy as well as some progress in creating educational informatics \u2018building blocks.\u2019 An international team also created a prototype standard for a Traveler\u2019s Electronic Health Record Template (TrERT) engaging members from all of the IMIA sections of the world. Notably, the Board of AMIA, after an important town hall meeting, authorized the staff to pursue Clinical Informatics Certification for informaticians, beginning with physicians. As a result, the Board received and subsequently approved a Professional Code for AMIA members. To enhance the visibility of AMIA, ACMI, and informatics beyond the professionals with the discipline, AMIA membership in the Council of Medical Specialty Societies was essential. AMIA was elected to full member of CMSS, and I was elected to the post of Treasurer. After an informal positive meeting with a few of the chairs of medical boards, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, with the support of John Lumpkin, funded AMIA to develop essentials for the content of clinical informatics as well as training requirements. I left my AMIA leadership role well before formal approval by ABMS was given due to continued successful work by Ted Shortliffe. During 2015, the AMIA Board contracted me to lead the development of a plan for an Advanced Inter-professional Clinical Informatics Training and Certification effort for all health professionals. The Board approved this resulting strategy, and this item has moved forward. To that end, at present I\u2019m helping the University of Virginia develop its Clinical Informatics Fellowship Program strategy. Throughout these many years, informatics, health policy, surgery, medical administration, and sports medicine have made substantial gains, yet much remains to be accomplished. Happily, those who work in the vineyard of informatics are uniformly intelligent and delightful colleagues. My great good fortune has been to know and work with so many exceptionally fine people. ", "Parvati Dev": "CEO, SimTabs LLC, and Innovation in Learning, Inc Past positions: Director, SUMMIT Lab, & Assoc. Dean for Learning Technologies, Stanford University Sch. of Medicine VP, Research and Development, CEMAX, Inc. President, IIT Foundation, and Advisor, IIT-IIT My path to informatics was serendipitous, influenced by people, circumstance, and some unexpected opportunities that knocked on my door, coupled with my own somewhat non-mainstream approach to career and life. Throughout, my subconscious compass has been that work has to inspire me, which has often led away from the mainstream into areas less explored. I had a traditional \u201cgirl\u2019s\u201d education in school, which meant English, French, and Domestic Science. I was very bad (read \u201cuninspired\u201d) at Domestic Science so, in despair, my parents sent me, for four months, to a boys\u2019 school, to attend their science classes. Since I attended classes for four different grades in parallel, I was supremely confused and absolutely delighted with the new world of science that then opened up. A chance viewing of an advertisement inviting applicants for the prestigious Indian Institutes of Technology, traditionally a very male preserve, led me into engineering and its analytic methods, which suited my need to understand how and why everything worked. I completed a PhD at Stanford University in the early days of neural modeling, worked as a staff scientist at MIT applying modeling methods to research on mammalian control of movement, and spent five fascinating years at MIT\u2019s think-tank, the Neurosciences Research Program (NRP), assisting with conferences on topics ranging from fundamental biochemical pathways to the clinical control of pain. At NRP\u2019s small, focused workshops, with speakers ranging from nobel laureates to dazzlingly brilliant young scientists, I saw what excellence could be, and how bringing brilliant and open minds together could generate sparks of insight around the room. I felt I saw lightning flashing from person to person. NRP also gave me an unparalleled breadth of exposure to topics from biochemistry to behavior, something that allowed me from then onward to be able to draw insights across disciplines and to view each new piece of knowledge in the context of a larger whole, an excellent background for work that I would eventually be doing in informatics. While at MIT, I married my classmate from engineering college, and we moved back to California, to the emerging Silicon Valley. Leaving Boston, and its rich academic environment, was a wrench, but the technology-rich environment of Palo Alto was equally stimulating. I moved between medicine (the Rehabilitation Research Center at the Veterans Hospital), corporate research (a startup that created the medical business of three-dimensional reconstruction from CT and MR scans), and academia (the SUMMIT e-learning laboratory that I led at Stanford University School of Medicine). It was at SUMMIT that I formally entered the world of informatics. At each step along this entire path, I was nudged, assisted, or enlightened by people with whom I worked, and to whom I am immensely grateful. My entry into informatics was completely due to Ted Shortliffe. In 1990, technology for medical education was a  very new field. To attract attention and support, we invited influential faculty members to visit and see demonstrations of our learning modules. Ted\u2019s Medical Informatics Section was just one floor below our lab, and he was one of our early invitees. Not only did he observe and listen carefully, he pointed out that education technology was an informatics topic, and he invited me to participate in the Informatics weekly faculty meeting. Through attendance at these meetings, where we discussed the state of informatics both within the division and more widely, through the weekly seminars, and through the AMIA meetings, I was introduced to the broad scope of medical informatics. Shortly thereafter, Ted sponsored me to be a member of ACMI, and through ACMI, I have met a global community, and collaborated with a good number of them. It was quickly clear that education technology was both a tool through which informatics could be taught and a field of informatics study in its own right. In our SUMMIT lab, we pursued both approaches, building many learning modules using hypermedia, 3D visualization, and simulation, obtaining grants to study the technologies and learning methods that could best use these technologies. Our first research project was also one of the first medical games, an anatomy identification game, developed in collaboration with Charles (Chuck) Friedman, who would become a long-time collaborator on many projects. Among the most exciting of the grants we received was one for exploring the educational opportunities opened by the Next Generation Internet, a grant from the National Library of Medicine\u2019s High Performance Computing division, managed by Michael Ackerman. An early supporter of the SUMMIT lab was Apple Computer, introduced to us by Robert Chase, Chief of Anatomy. Apple provided our initial technology and brought me into a supportive community of leading medical educators in New England, New York, and Washington, DC, including Robert Greenes, Naomi Broering, and others, all creating this new field of medical education technology. But it was through Suzanne Stensaas\u2019s Slice of Life image collection project that I obtained the most startling new insight: the power of open content. It took more than a decade for this educational concept to expand beyond her original project into today\u2019s open courses. My eighteen years leading the SUMMIT lab at Stanford produced many contributions to education in medicine. Through building many different interactive learning modules, we found that one could find underlying structure in the content: we introduced the concept of markup languages for easy authoring tools even before HTML came on the scene. Our Short Rounds case authoring and case-viewing tool gave rise to numerous similar efforts around the world, many of which are still in use. The Curriculum Web project was the first of its kind to capture and digitize all content being taught in the medical curriculum, including all lectures, handouts, and quizzes. It was also the first to stop using home-built systems and take advantage of a commercial learning management system. The project faced much criticism for allowing students to skip classes, but this only highlighted a trend that was already taking place. Today, the current equivalent of the Curriculum Web is the basis of the flipped classroom at Stanford. With the Next Generation Internet (NGI), we explored haptically-enabled surgical simulation and built haptic laparoscopic tools that later formed the basis of commercial surgical simulators. Through NGI, together with our colleagues, Steven Senger at University of Wisconsin and Kevin Smith at CSIRO, Canberra, Australia, and with LeRoy Heinrichs and Sakti Srivastava at Stanford, we studied the power of multi- user surgical simulations, and developed \u201cmaster classes\u201d between Australia and California, where a teacher in Australia could place their virtual hand on the learner\u2019s hand in California, and guide their surgical movements. Through the support of  Sweden\u2019s Wallenberg Foundation, as well as support from the ARMY TATRC organization, we explored the potential of medical \u201cvirtual worlds\u201d and showed, for the first time, that medical students practicing a trauma scenario in a virtual emergency room could learn teamwork principles just as well as those practicing in a physical space with a manikin as a simulated patient. In retrospect, in spite of all of our firsts and our awards, our greatest contribution was the education we provided the world about the leading edge of medical education technology. We were an open, friendly lab that encouraged visitors and interns, so much so that one year, we hosted over one hundred visiting teams in our lab. What are the lessons learned in this serendipitous journey? A key lesson was that I was always stronger when I reached out and created a collaborative project, often with someone more experienced or better known than myself, but who provided complementary capabilities. This went against the conventional wisdom at the time, which encouraged individual research over collaboration. However, our collaborative approach resulted in a lab that was known throughout the medical education technology world. Another lesson, well-known though it is, was to not hesitate in hiring someone who could outperform me, as long as I had the skill to keep everyone coordinated. What barriers or hurdles did I encounter? One possible barrier, being female, has never been a personal obstacle for me. Perhaps because of my background in a male engineering college, I was less susceptible to being categorized by others as being of the other sex. If I do not notice that I am the only woman in a room, others soon forget it as well (even though I am visibly different in my traditional sari). Another barrier, one that may derive from being too focused on topics of interest to me, is not thinking big enough, not thinking at a systems level. There is a value to seeing one\u2019s efforts in the context of the organization\u2019s growth and needs. Yes, our lab did very well and was recognized internationally, but it could have become an international center for research into education innovation. All I can say is that I did not have a personal interest in going that direction, and what does not interest me, I cannot do. Looking back, my years at Stanford and in the informatics world were fruitful for me and for a large number of people. Could I have done it differently? Perhaps if someone had encouraged me to look beyond the trees to the forest, I might have realized how critical educational innovation would be to the world. I did not grasp the significance of that trend at that time but stayed focused on the specifics of each innovation. I have since left Stanford to start my own education innovation company with the belief that it is time to create commercially available learning products to really impact education innovation. This is a new exploration, and I look forward to what the journey will bring. ", "Amado Espinosa": "Founder & CEO, Medisist, Mexico Member of Advisory Committees & Working Groups For IMIA, PAHO, WHO, ISO/TC215, HL-7, WITSA, SNOMED, NLM, and Rockefeller Foundation In medical school, I wanted to become a physician who could help people in need, while also having an interest in the scientific basis of the professions. For this, I took courses in physics and mathematics at the University. However, it was not until I joined the genetics lab at the A. Espinosa, MD, MCS, MBA, PhD medical school that I learned about the scientific method and the clinical application of mathematical models. Clinical practice brought me into closer relationships with patients, which I was able to combine with research work in pursuing a specialty in anesthesiology. After more than 7 years of academic experience, I was invited to take on administrative duties, which is why I also sought an MBA degree. This led to a brief fellowship at the Mayo Clinic Hospital in Rochester, which had a strong effect on me since the technology in the operating room (OR) was impressive, especially for anesthesia. When I returned to Mexico, I decided to learn more about computers in healthcare, so when I completed my training as an anesthesiologist, I took a MS course in Computer Science at the Technological University of the Americas. Microelectronics and mathematics as well as hardware and software were part of the curriculum, which helped me acquire the background needed to pursue doctoral studies at the Institute of Medical Informatics at the Medical School Hannover. Before leaving Mexico, I taught at the medical school in Puebla, instructing students for the very first time in the use of computers for statistics and research protocols. I also developed an EMR with an HP 150, according to Mexican requirements and following the Mayo Clinic standards. At the MHH, I was the first Latin American PhD student in the area of Medical Informatics. I started developing a comprehensive EMR for anesthesiology, which included the processing and storage of EEG signals. I was then invited by Prof. Reichertz to join the clinical group at the institute and to lead a project developing a system for the semi-automatic encoding of medical terms, to fulfill the legal requirements for the 1,500- bed hospital. Since Prof. Wingert was an expert in natural language processing from the MHH, I visited him in Muenster to learn about his work and experience. The system was implemented and used extensively, serving as the basis for my dissertation. By this time (1985-90), working with an IBM 370 system and integrating applications with the PACS and EMR systems, I learned much about classification, nomenclatures, and standards models that were internationally accepted. The Institute was a leading academic participant in European and USA activities, leading me to participate in SCAMC, GMDS, and EFMI meetings, where I met extraordinary colleagues who supported me on how to organize the academic sector in Mexico and Latin America, and how to collaborate and exchange experiences to deploy IT solutions for healthcare. On returning from my training in Germany to Mexico through the invitation of the Mexican Health Foundation, I founded the Institute for Medical Informatics at the Autonomous University of Guadalajara, the Center for Medical Documentation and Information at the University of Guadalajara (the second largest in Mexico), and  organized the Mexican Medical Informatics Association; and I also formalized, incorporated, and served as president of the International Medical Informatics Association for Latin America and Caribbean (IMIA-LAC), and organized national, regional, and international conferences and congresses on MI to train, integrate, and connect healthcare and computer professionals in the field of MI. In Latin America, the use of an EMR in the 1990\u2019s was not required, and the field of Medical Informatics was still at a very early stage. I joined the Autonomous University of Guadalajara to collaborate on a project (supported at the beginning by IBM) to develop a Hospital Information System for the Mexican environment. Eventually, and with the support from the Hewlett-Packard Biomedical Division, and we were able to deploy this originary model of HIS in Mexico, supported by guidance from Prof. Paul Clayton (Columbia University), Ed Hammond (Duke University), and Jochen Moehr (University of Victoria). This HIS included DSS, computer applications, and statistical packages for medical students. We developed a unit for computer programs to train students in basic topics as well as to prepare them to answer Board examinations. I organized a postgraduate program in Medical Informatics and a Community College pathway to train Informaticians for the Healthcare sector. In 1993, we organized the Mexican Medical Informatics Association (AMIM), which was launched during the first international conference (Infomedica 93), where IMIA, WHO, EFMI, and AMIA representatives attended as keynote speakers. Based on the success of the first meeting, we organized a second one (Infomedica 95), with the participation of PAHO, the IMIA Board, industry, and the Ministry of Health. This brought representatives from 24 countries in Latin America, to formalize and incorporate IMIA-LAC. Afterwards, a delegation of IMIA- LAC representatives attended Medinfo 95 in Vancouver. At this point I joined the University of Guadalajara as the academic coordinator for the Life Sciences Campus, developing the first computerized library in the country for training medical professionals and with integrated long-distance programs and applications to support academia and researchers. The topic of medical informatics was integrated into the Master\u2019s and PhD programs in Science. In order to bring theory into practice, I decided to start a commercial consortium with colleagues from Colombia and Chile, sponsored by Microsoft and HP, to develop a HIS platform running on PCs. It was at the very early stage of net servers, Microsoft systems, and the internet, and for that reason, the adoption of the technology took longer than expected. I joined IMIA working groups, helped institutions to sign collaboration agreements, and invited national and international students to be part of our team to innovate, develop, and deploy computer applications into healthcare practice. Practitioners, managers, administrators, and technicians need to understand processes and technology and their effect on professionals who use the systems. Only in this way can we add value to the healthcare system. Combining research and entrepreneurship looks like a natural trend when you try to address the challenge of how to bring the benefits of IT into the healthcare sector quickly and broadly. It includes a closer relationship between industry and government, and a practical approach towards engagement with the user. Through PAHO\u2019s support, we had access to the platform developed by the VA system, which is one of the most comprehensive information systems ever developed. We also learned a lot from the different standardization committees, commercial organizations like HIMSS, healthcare reforms in Latin America, and InfoPath experiences in Europe and Canada. The consortium brought together three different companies in Colombia, Chile, and Mexico. As the Mexican one, we were invited to develop the platform for primary care for the largest healthcare system in  Mexico (IMSS), with more than 50 million clients. Afterwards, other projects in the private sector turned into success stories which spread the word and allowed us to keep innovating and deploying IT solutions for improving healthcare services. I was invited to foster the first IT consortium in Jalisco, Mexico, which was expected to prepare companies to compete in the international market. I also joined an international program for Management of Technology companies. These recognized that a key factor was to adopt international standards for quality in software and to integrate vertical solutions in the healthcare sector. Both organizations succeeded in their collective efforts of combining new technologies, through which research centers in Mexico and abroad were encouraged to collaborate in helping decision makers to see how IT can serve as a natural means of triggering quality and innovation in healthcare. As a result, several Ministries of Health in Latin America requested my advice on best methods for implementing national IT projects. Jalisco has, since the 1970\u2019s, become the Silicon Valley of Mexico. Major companies such as IBM, HP, Flex, Foxconn, Texas Instruments, Freescale, Intel, Siemens, Continental as well as software corporations such as Oracle, TCS, BOSCH, and Accenture have all located there. One of their main concerns is how to add value to the products they design and produce locally. Collaborations with local providers to build local capacity has become the top priority, and a good opportunity to bring high tech into the healthcare sector. The industry of medical devices is nowadays one of the most exciting areas to work in. We are bringing together industry (Texas Instruments, NXP, Intel) and academia to train industry professionals in best practices for embedded SW, sensors, microelectronics, DSPs, and user interfaces; to produce smart devices to cope with chronic diseases, helping users access digital health solutions through telemonitoring and telemedicine; and to facilitate exposure to on-line healthcare services, training, and literature. The promise of IoT, machine learning, natural language processing, personal health records, and smart stations for self-care could lead to the next wave fulfilling UN Strategic Goals in healthcare. Industry offers many opportunities for academics, which is why I serve as VP for international affairs and the VP for eHealth initiatives with the national chamber of electronic industries (CANIETI) and the national association of IT industries (AMITI). I have been invited to represent our country to international organizations like the World IT Services Alliance (WITSA), where I served as the treasurer, the Internet Governance Forum (IGF), and at the Latin-American IT Association (ALETI), where we promoted the collaboration and exchange of experiences among Ibero-American societies. In 2011, we hosted a world conference on IT public policies (GPPS), and in 2014, a world congress on ICT (WCIT 2014). As chairman of both events, I encouraged the Organizing Committee to include a special track on Medical Informatics, where IMIA and PAHO representatives met Mexican and Regional professionals to take advantage of the networking and academic opportunities. In addition, the Digital Transformation meetings in Guadalajara in 2017 and 2018 led to invitations to representatives of EFMI, IFIP, AMIA, and WHO to join us and discuss cooperation models to speed up ICT support for healthcare. Cooperation with the European Agency of Innovation raises the promise of involving experts in Smart & Resilient Cities (including self-management of care) in the future. As past-President of IMIA-LAC, I organized INFOLAC 2018 in La Habana, Cuba, attended IFIP meetings, had discussions with PAHO\u2019s Regional Advisor on eHealth and Knowledge Management, met with the \u201cTele-health Network of the Americas\u201d coordinators from the Organization of American States, organized meetings with the e-  Health International Telecommunication Union Group, participated at the initiatives of e-LAC (UN \u2013 CEPAL), and collaborated on an OECD project involving ICTs in Health Systems. The AMIA Board has also expressed interest in developing regional training programs and organizing joint meetings. I visited medical informatics organizations in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Mexico, Uruguay, and El Salvador and encouraged societies in Ecuador, Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, Puerto Rico, Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, Dominican Republic, and Venezuela to support their efforts to organize. Medical Informatics is one of the most exciting and promising fields of research and development. Data is the lifeblood of health care and takes many forms. Most administrators and clinicians need to acquire the expertise to effectively collect, store, and interpret data, which explains why career opportunities for health informatics professionals have never been more promising. College students and health professionals working in other specialties are no doubt wondering what kind of education, skill sets, and experience will be needed to take advantage of the shifting health care scene. The population is getting older, the cost of medical care is outpacing the resources of healthcare systems, the science that underpins patient care is increasingly complex, and the accumulation of biomedical information is growing exponentially. The impact of the th 4 industrial revolution is widespread, but arguably few industries have felt the impact more than the health informatics field. From blockchain applications to AI vital- monitoring wearable sensors, from DNA sequencing to DSS, smart technology is taking the health care world by storm and remodeling patient care delivery. The current, undeniably fascinating, leap in information technology could result in an Orwellian nightmare: healthcare decreed by uncaring anonymous bureaucratic calculation with human disease and its treatment reduced to formulaic rules, implemented by an automated decision system. Medical informatics needs to counter such a development. It is up to us, as experts in the field, to ensure that medical informatics is dedicated primarily to those individuals who truly need help\u2014our patients. It is up to us to identify what makes our patients unique, and then define these unique characteristics, so that they become a visible part of the data gathered and all patients, including the outliers, can be better served. International Journal of Medical Informatics, 1998; 49: 97-104 ", "R. Scott Evans": " Medical Informatics Director R. S. Evans, MS, PhD, FACMI Intermountain Healthcare (retired) Professor, Biomedical Informatics University of Utah School of Medicine I thought I wanted to be an electrical engineer and went to college on a football scholarship. During fall semester, the engineering professor said that when we graduated, finding a job would be hard. Nothing could have been further from the truth. During my senior year of high school, I had taken an anatomy and physiology class that I really enjoyed and many of the football players were physical education majors and had to take anatomy and physiology. So, I registered for the class since I wasn\u2019t going to find a job in electrical engineering. Professor Lyle Lowder was an excellent and interesting teacher and very personable. At the end of the semester he told me I was the first football player to get a straight A in his class and wondered if I was interested in medicine. By the end of my sophomore year in college, I changed my major to pre-med. During my senior year, there were a series of large medical malpractice lawsuits in the U.S, controversy about medical insurance increases, and many students were changing their minds about medical school. Another advisor said medicine would never be the same and might turn into socialized medicine and suggested we think about dental school. That proved to be bad advice. During my senior year I took a parasitology class from Dr. Richard A. Heckman which I also really enjoyed and decided to get a Master\u2019s Degree in Parasitology and Microbiology while deciding what to do. I had two good friends who were college football teammates who had started a construction company. I found that I could make more money and learn useful skills working Saturdays and especially summers during college building houses than working at part-time jobs during the week. The construction business was busy and I decided to work in construction for the next year after I got my Master\u2019s degree while deciding what to do next. I was thinking of getting a PhD in parasitology or microbiology but during the first year of construction, four others were going to build their own homes working nights and Saturdays and wanted to know if I wanted to do it also. It sounded like a good idea at the time. So, during the next three years, that\u2019s what we did\u2014we built five houses during nights and Saturdays. That is something that I\u2019m glad I did but wouldn\u2019t want to do again, especially during the winter. After the houses were built and I had more free time at night and weekends, I found myself reading old textbooks and realized how much I had forgotten and wondered if all the hard work I had put into college had been wasted. In addition, I realized I still had a desire to learn, even if it was information I had learned before. I heard about Bioengineering, and the more I read about it, the more it sounded like what I had been interested in all along\u2026a combination of electrical engineering and medicine. During March 1981, as I was getting ready to turn in my application for the doctoral program in Bioengineering, the department chair mentioned that earlier the department had been Medical Biophysics and Bioengineering. The department had divided, and the  chair of the Medical Biophysics department was Dr. Homer Warner, located at the LDS Hospital. I asked questions about the department and it sounded interesting, especially in how it used computers in medicine. But I had finally decided to get a PhD in Bioengineering. If I had lived south of the University of Utah, I know I would have driven straight home. However, my home was in North Salt Lake and I would pass close to LDS Hospital on the way home. As I got close to where I could turn towards LDS Hospital, which was just five blocks out of my way, I once again started to wonder what I should do. I had recognized the name of Homer Warner. I had often heard about what a wonderful man he was. The mother of two friends who started the construction business was retired but she had worked for Dr. Warner as a grant manager for several years. By coincidence, 12 years before I had met Dr. Warner outside his office, when my friends needed to exchange car keys with their mother. I was just tagging along and followed them up to their mother\u2019s office. We exchanged keys and before we could leave, their mother wanted them to say hello to Dr. Warner. They knew Dr. Warner from having enjoyed department summer picnics together. I was standing in the hall when Dr. Warner came out to shake my friends\u2019 hands and talk about how my friends were doing. Within a minute, Dr. Warner noticed me standing in the hall and came over and shook my hand and asked me how I was and treated me like an old friend. It took only a minute to get a wonderful feeling about Dr. Warner, and understand why my friends, and especially their mother, had such a high opinion of him. I think it was my first impression of Dr. Warner that made go to LDS Hospital. I somehow found my way to the department of Medical Biophysics and asked if I could see Dr. Warner. Although I did not have an appointment, they checked to see if he was in his office, which told me that Dr. Warner was helpful to students. Since he was not in, the secretary suggested we see if Dr. Pryor in the next office down the hall was there. He was not, but then she said let\u2019s check Dr. Gardner\u2019s office. Dr. Gardner was in his office and he invited me in. I asked him for information about what the department did. He asked me about my background and seemed interested when I said I already had a master\u2019s degree and used a computer to help analyze the statistics for my thesis. When I said my master\u2019s degree was in Microbiology and Parasitology, he became very interested. He said that they had chemistry and hematology data coded in the electronic medical record. I didn\u2019t know what that meant at the time, but he said they had been trying to get microbiology data entered for the past three years but couldn\u2019t because the programmers did not know anything about microbiology, and it was too confusing. He asked me a few questions about microbiology and then told me to wait and he\u2019d be right back. I could hear file cabinets opening and closing and Dr. Gardner speaking to the women at the front desk but couldn\u2019t understand what they were talking about. Dr. Gardner came back in his office all excited and gave me a stack of papers and told me to fill them out and get them to him along with my college transcripts and three letters of recommendation from my Master\u2019s committee within a week\u2014before they met to select the fall semester students. So, based on my first impression of Dr. Warner, the idea of using computers in medicine, Dr. Gardner\u2019s help and enthusiasm, and especially being able to apply my previous education and background in microbiology and parasitology, that\u2019s what I did. I hoped I had made a good decision but had no idea what wonderful opportunities and hundreds of new friends that decision would bring. Personal Contributions: My dissertation project was to first get coded microbiology data into the EMR. I worked with a programmer, Alan Bush, to develop an interface from the laboratory information system to the HELP System. He helped  teach me programming while I developed the hierarchical microbiology database and explained the different criteria we needed for the program. Once we had coded microbiology data stored in the HELP System EMR, it could finally be viewed from anywhere in the hospital within seconds of it being entered into the laboratory information system. I then developed a program that contained the CDC criteria for hospital-acquired infection identification and the antibiotic logic from infectious diseases experts, Drs. John Burke, Jay Jacobson and Bob Larsen. That program was automatically activated (data-driven) as soon as microbiology results and antibiotic orders were stored in the EMR. The evaluation of the program showed that the computer could identify more hospital-acquired infections than three infection control nurses using manual methods, identify patients not receiving appropriate antibiotics, patients who could receive less expensive antibiotics and patients who had been receiving prophylactic antibiotics too long. A paper based on my dissertation was published in JAMA in 1986. My first experiences in medical informatics taught me many things. First, you can only learn to program computers by programming computers. I learned that the hardest part of designing, developing, implementing and maintaining a computer application is evaluating it. The value and benefit of many computer programs are never really known. Fortunately, I realized early on that you need to add additional code to store logs and data from a running application in order to facilitate the evaluation. Application evaluation is also the best method to find bugs and improve the code. I learned to always look at every possible finding of an application evaluation for future work. During the evaluation of my dissertation, we were amazed to find patients receiving preoperative antibiotics the whole time they were in the hospital without any indication of an infection. That led to the development of another application to notify pharmacists of surgery patients on antibiotics too long. That resulted in a significant reduction in inappropriate antibiotic use. During the evaluation of that application, I found most patients who needed preoperative antibiotics didn\u2019t get them within two hours before incision. We developed another application to identify patients who needed preoperative antibiotics, notifying surgeons and nurses to improve the timing of preoperative antibiotics which reduced postoperative wounds. We then found that many patients didn\u2019t receive appropriate antibiotics based on the microbiology culture results. So, we developed an application to identify the best and least expensive antibiotics for patients. While we were evaluating that application, Stanley L. Pestotnik, the pharmacist I was working with, started to wonder if antibiotic A cost $10 less a day than antibiotic B, but antibiotic A caused more adverse drug reactions, wouldn\u2019t antibiotic B be better to recommend and less expensive in the long run. In an effort to find which antibiotics caused ADEs, we found that there were only 9-10 voluntarily reported adverse drug events per year at LDS hospital. A subsequent literature search and a meeting on adverse drug events we attended revealed that hospital-wide adverse drug event (ADE) surveillance was something only done for short time periods and mainly based on voluntary reporting by clinicians. Since I had developed an application to identify hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), we decided to see if we could develop a program to monitor patients every day and identify ADEs. However, to identify HAIs, I had used the CDC published guidelines and we found there were no similar published guidelines to identify ADEs. Through a literature search and based on the clinical expertise of Stan Pestotnik and Dr. David Classen, we developed our own set of guidelines or what we called \u201cflags or triggers\u201d of possible ADEs based on laboratory results, drug levels, medication orders and nurse and pharmacist charting. That application soon identified over 600 pharmacist-verified moderate and severe ADEs in one year compared to the previous 9 or 10. Evaluation of  that application and root cause analyses of the ADEs showed how we could reduce the number of ADEs through real-time follow-up and additional applications. These evaluations and studies also showed us that you can only manage what you can identify and measure. Without knowing which drugs were causing ADEs we never would have found ways to prevent them. From ADEs, we moved to using computer applications with very complex logic and patient-specific information to further improve anti-infective agent use and further reduce ADEs. Then two infection preventionists (IPs), Rouett Abuzelof and Carrie Taylor were frustrated by the fact that a patient with a multi- drug resistant organism (MDRO) could be admitted back to a semi-private room in the same hospital within a week and they were not notified. Jim Lloyd and I decided to develop a MDRO DataMart that was updated each night by a program Jim developed. We developed other programs to send emails with a list of patients admitted within 24 hours and with a previous MDRO. Another program Jim developed monitored every patient within Intermountain Healthcare with a previous MDRO every 5 minutes and sent pager alerts to IPs and nursing supervisors that a patient is about to be admitted. Infections in central lines and Foley catheters and ADEs caused by infusion pump programming errors led to an interest in potential harm from other medical devices. I was able to work with Kyle V. Johnson and then Steve Howe to reduce adverse medical device events, initially with ventilator disconnections and then infusion pump programming errors and critical bedside monitor alarms. Reducing peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) infections led us to identify and reduce PICC associated deep venous thrombosis (DVT), which in turn led to the need to identify all DVTs and then pulmonary embolisms. These efforts have led to the development of 65 applications to prevent patient harm in patients including those mentioned above, cardiology, intensive care, medical devices, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. My work has revolved around using information technology to identify and prevent patient harm. I\u2019ve found that 99% of patient-harm results because someone didn\u2019t have all the information they needed\u2026when they needed it. I have been very fortunate to have been mentored by some of Medical Informatics best and original pioneers\u2014Homer Warner, Reed Gardner, Alan Pryor, and Paul Clayton\u2014 and work with the electronic medical record they developed as a clinical and research system. In addition, I have been able to work with a very innovative, hard-working, and fun team for the past 27 years who should be given credit for the success of many of the applications we have developed\u2014Jim Lloyd, Kyle Johnson, and Steve Howe. I have also had the privilege to work with numerous physicians, nurses, pharmacists, respiratory therapists, and other clinicians at Intermountain Healthcare who I admire for their desire to improve patient care and prevent harm. I should also give credit to the advice from my high school sophomore advisor, Mrs. Reese, who did say, \u201csome students will be working in fields that have not been invented yet.\u201d ", "Julio Facelli": "Professor of Biomedical Informatics, The University of Utah Fellow, Academy of Health Science Educators Fellow, American College of Medical Informatics My first contact with Biomedical (in those days Medical) Informatics was a seminar in the Department of th Medical Informatics at Utah on my 50 birthday. At that time, I was Director of the Utah Center for High Performance Computing (CHPC) and Professor Reed Gardner was on my advisory board. He was interested in bringing HPC to his Department and invited me to give a seminar, which coincidentally was scheduled on my birthday. I always will remember Reed coming with this huge cake at the end of the seminar and the faculty and students singing happy birthday. After the seminar I considered my duties to Reed done and went back to CHCP and my research in computational molecular simulations. Reed insisted that there were many opportunities for HPC and advance computing in biomedical informatics and secured for me an adjunct appointment in his Department. As adjunct faculty, I was expected to attend the graduate seminar and to serve on students\u2019 committees, which I did reluctantly at the beginning. Fairly quickly, though, the computational and informatics challenges in biomedical informatics got my attention; the opportunity to use my experience in HPC, distributed computing, academic computing, and management of core computational services to solve biomedical problems got me intellectually stimulated; and I developed several collaborations with faculty in biomedical informatics. Among them I remember some of our early work in using genetic algorithms for bioinformatics, the use of Grid computing for epidemiological surveillance, and the development of HIPPA-compliant HPC environments to facilitate high end applications using restricted data. After several years as adjunct professor and with the arrival of Professor Joyce Mitchell, I considered it timely to make a formal commitment to biomedical informatics; I assumed a full professorship in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Utah and at Joyce\u2019 s request became vice-chair and interim chair of the Department upon her retirement. I do not regret my transition from computational molecular modeling work, which I still love, into biomedical informatics, and fortunately in recent years, I have had the opportunity to develop a research program that bridges the two disciplines. With Dr. Ebbert, we applied Monte Carlo (MC) techniques to understand uncertainty quantification (UQ) in breast tumor classification; with Dr. Thibault, we used data modeling techniques to develop an informatics infrastructure to support biomolecular simulation work, and more recently, we used protein structure prediction to understand pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease and facilitate de novo variant annotation. Finally, in recent years I became a member of the Nano Institute of Utah, and working with Dr. Jones and Professor Ghandehari, we pioneered the use of multiple informatics techniques in nanomedicine. I consider that my strong background in quantitative science\u2014a PhD in Physics from the University of Buenos Aires\u2014is a tremendous asset in today\u2019s biomedical informatics research. As we move towards the golden age of precision medicine,  quantitative modeling, large-scale data integration, and uncertainty quantification are becoming central to the advance of medical sciences. I feel that there are incredible possibilities for the application of my background in computational physics and chemistry towards meeting today\u2019s challenges in biomedical and translational medical sciences. In my opinion, the grand challenges in biomedical informatics are in the areas of computable semantic complexity, internet of things (IoT), and uncertainty quantification (UQ). Let me elaborate in the following paragraphs. In recent years, great advances have been made in deploying electronic health records (EHRs) worldwide, and it is almost universally recognized that EHRs are a necessary tool for modern medicine and clinical and translational research. Nonetheless, data integration remains a challenge, and most practicing physicians find EHRs extremely constraining to the expression of their knowledge and observations about the patient. Not surprisingly, a great deal of the information stored in EHRs is in the form of text, which, in spite of some progress in NLP, remains practically non-computable. Arguably, we really do not know how to make the extraordinary semantically complex description of clinical observations and processes computable. In my opinion, this is a fundamental scientific problem, and I wish government agencies like NIH (primary NLM) and NSF would establish long-term research programs in this area. I believe that we have made great progress in genomics, but as recognized in several recent studies, genomic background is determinant of only 20-30% of our phenotype and health outcomes, with the remainder determined by environmental and social factors, which recent literature has named the \u201cexposome.\u201d In the near future, whole genome sequencing will become routinely available, but without a complementary effort to measure the \u201cexposome,\u201d progress in the understanding of common diseases at the personalized level will be unlikely. The use of IoT technologies as measuring tools to characterize the \u201cexposome\u201d is promising, but how to do it is a daunting informatics problem. Clearly, na\u00efve approaches like measure everything, dump it in a large data store, and use AI to extract knowledge will not work. A great deal of informatics research is needed to develop measurement frameworks for the IoT that will provide the desirable amount and type of data needed to integrate with genomic and phenotypic data to move personalized medicine forward. Fortunately, programs like the NIBIB PRISMS, for which I am co-PI of one of the informatics centers with Professor Kathy Sward, are making progress in this challenge. With the increase in data available for medical research and practice, there has been a great deal of interest in using computational modeling for both biomedical research and clinical practice, with special emphasis on personalized medicine. While UQ has been a topic of substantial research in the physical and engineering sciences, where the use of computational modeling is considered almost routine, to my knowledge very little attention has been dedicated to understanding UQ principles, applications, and consequences in translational medical research and personalized medicine. This lack of attention to UQ, despite the serious clinical implications that it can have in personalized medicine, has to be addressed immediately. We have demonstrated the importance of UQ in two areas of translational medicine: computerized guidelines for prevention using family health history and genetically guided treatment of cancer; however, our work is just addressing relatively simple cases, using well established MC methods, and a great deal of work is necessary to fully understand UQ in translational medical sciences and precision medicine. ", "John Flint": "J. Flint, COACH & IMIA Interestingly enough, I've never taken the time to write down the reasons I ended up in the IT\u2014or informatics\u2014branch of Healthcare. I've often said that I've had several careers, including Accounting, Hospital Administration, Hospital Information Systems, and Owner of a Small Business in the health IT sector focusing on the development of EMR and interoperability. To my mind each of these additions to a career evolved quite naturally, one building on the other. When I was in Accounting I often worked on financial audits for Hospitals and found myself attracted by the opportunity to make improvements to what I saw as a very cumbersome model for delivering care. When I returned from Bermuda to Canada, the perfect opening became available\u2014the Controllership of a small but rapidly growing hospital in the suburbs of Toronto called York Central in Richmond Hill. There I was involved with the planning and construction of a very large expansion along with all its information needs. The first step was to vastly improve the financial systems, and we became one of the first hospitals in Canada in 1972 to acquire a very new technology: the minicomputer. This garnered our hospital a positive reputation for being able to manage a development project such that in 1975, York Central was selected to be the pilot site as the first hospital in Canada to install the IBM Patient Care System which had been developed by IBM in partnership with Duke University Hospital, at the same time as Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas. This software needed to be modified to suit the different requirements of the Canadian market and we proceeded with that, so that it had more functionality around patient care than any other system with perhaps the exception of El Camino in Mountainview, California. This functionality was the reason I was attracted as Project Director\u2014we had the opportunity to change and hopefully improve many of the processes then employed in most hospitals. We could get lab/imaging results and reports back to wherever the patient was receiving services at that time. Our physicians, because they were involved in the steering committee, saw the advantages in getting results faster\u2014they could make better, more informed decisions for patient care. Nurses and doctors used lite-pen technology screens to avoid the need for typing. Some physicians liked the system because results were available to them in their office. However, because of the high cost of technology to support this application, it was not as cost effective as it is today\u2014but this was 1978. The hospital found that its use of a unit dose drug system became more affordable using this technology. We employed a benefit-oriented implementation using Methods Analysts to perform pre- and post- studies, so we had the opportunity to make these changes cost effective. In Sept. 1979, I presented a paper at ECHO (Electronic Computing Health Oriented), entitled \u201cPatient Care Systems\u2014Finding the Payback,\u201d outlining these methods and the results. This methodology was met with skepticism in some quarters as taking money away from frontline care and reducing the nurse/doctor-patient face time; however, anyone who talked to our staff found that they supported our approach as they saw the  benefits. Throughout this implementation, we utilized experienced medical and paramedical staff to ensure the success of this project. I should note that the only other hospital with systems similar to ours at that time was Saint John General New Brunswick, which was using the Technicon system. York Central Hospital became the demonstration site for IBM worldwide, so we received hundreds of visitors from all over the world. Many of our staff became very good at making presentations to these visitors. They did this with pride. In an effort to keep these same staff challenged enough to remain at York Central, I was able to convince the Hospital Board that it would be a good idea to create a business model for a company separate from but controlled by the hospital. This company was incorporated in 1979 and was known as York Central Health Systems (YCHS), and it still exists today, though in a different format and under different ownership. At that time, I was a Vice-President of the hospital and also President of this company. YCHS was owned by the hospital until 1987 and used its installation expertise at hospitals in Montreal, Calgary, Vancouver, and Toronto. Later, two Project Managers Dennis Rankin and Peter Catford became so recognized for their capabilities that they played a major role when Baxter became involved in Health IT. Eventually, the Hospital Board asked me whether I wanted to be in the running to replace the retiring President of the Hospital or to follow my \u201ccomputer leanings.\u201d In fact, by this time I had become more fascinated by operating a private business than being a hospital executive. At the same time, the Hospital Board decided to offer the business to me. After consultation with my wife, we purchased the business through a series of donations to the Hospital. I found rather quickly that operating under the umbrella of the hospital and operating on one\u2019s own were two very different things. When I was working for the hospital, I was on the road to attend and deliver many presentations to other hospitals, at conferences such as COACH and ECHO, participating in numerous provincial or federal committees. At the peak of this \u201coutside activity,\u201d I was on the Board of COACH from 1977 and President in 1981 and 82. MEDINFO \u201877 interested me greatly, and I expressed an interest in becoming the IMIA representative for Canada when Dr. David Shires retired from IMIA. Donald Lindberg was nominating chair and asked if I knew anything about accounting. This would be the first time an accountant took on the role of Treasurer. As a professional accountant or CPA, I was alarmed by the state of IMIA\u2019s finances. I quickly learned that there were very limited funds, and those were in the hands of a manager the Board had trusted, and who may have fallen on hard times. My first job was to track down IMIA\u2019s funds and determine who really had signing authority over them, so I travelled to Amsterdam where the manager resided. I arranged to meet him at the airport, but he did not show up. That was a bad sign! I then rented a car and drove to the bank, where I assumed that, as IMIA Treasurer, I would be able to get access to the funds or to change the signing authority, but no, it turned out that I would have to go to the County Administration to enter a plea to get access to IMIA funds, even though I was identified as the IMIA Treasurer. This became impossible, so later that day I called the bank and they told me that the IMIA manager had just left the bank! I drove to the manager\u2019s house in Aalsmeer and knocked on his door, but there was no answer. I was sure he was in there, so I went around to the kitchen side of the house and noticed a fresh apple core sitting on the kitchen table. Now I knew he was there, so I said, \u201cArvid, I know you are there!\u201d I didn't get a response and returned to Canada with no money but a hold on the IMIA account.  This has been a good story to tell over the years. When I reported the story back to the President of COACH, the late Al Haskell, he had an artist draw a cartoon of me wearing a hunting outfit and holding an empty bag of money. However, it was hardly a funny story for IMIA, because even though I had cut out this manager\u2019s access to future monies, there wasn\u2019t much left to work with. IMIA President Hans Peterson and I met and agreed that we could manage the secretariat needs between us to control costs, but that we needed to increase revenues dramatically\u2014so we presented a plan to double the current national society membership fees to the Board in a meeting in Oslo, where we received its full support. Thus began a six-year period where the secretariat address was the office of YCHS in Richmond Hill. I have collected many stamps from the correspondence with all our IMIA member countries. What a wonderful time period that was for me, as I had the chance to travel all around the world, albeit mostly at my own expense, since COACH was only able to afford a $2000 per year stipend. My wife, Cheryl, enjoys travel as much as I do and accompanied me on many of the trips, and our children also came along a few times. Cheryl and I met many interesting people, and she still keeps a letter received from Mary Lindberg thanking her for being such a fine host to so many of the IMIA participants\u2019 spouses at one of our events in Vancouver. It was a great learning experience for me, as I had the benefit of advice from past- President David Shires and working closely with Presidents Hans Peterson and the late Shigekoto Kaihara. Both Hans and Kai had great international experience, and I tried to learn as much as possible from both of them: especially how to run meetings and how to get them to reach a consensus. On one occasion, Kai and I were in East Berlin working with the Chinese delegation on the organization of Medinfo 89 for Beijing. I was pleased to be included in the discussions regarding the fate of Medinfo 89 as Kai returned to Japan following the Tiananmen Square disruption. The solution, retaining a reduced Medinfo for the benefit of our Chinese colleagues who had worked so hard while finding a new site in Singapore, was very insightful. I was pleased with that compromise, as we had worked with the Chinese delegations for several years, and we appreciated the effort they had put into mounting the conference. My two terms as Treasurer ended in 1989, and for two years I remained the IMIA representative and was Trustee for that period. My contribution to IMIA was much reduced at that point as reality struck home: as the sole owner of a healthcare IT company, I had to focus much more on the \u201chomefront.\u201d It was time for me to change the focus of YCHS from a hospital systems provider to a medical office system developer. Around this time, the Canadian hospital market was finally waking up and big US companies were being invited in, so it became very competitive and costly for a small company like ours to try to get and maintain market share. Our decision was to enter the physician office marketplace instead, starting with administrative systems development, to be followed by an early-stage EMR. This market had not developed to the point where it was attractive to big public companies, so our competition was with much smaller companies. That was a more level playing field. My next involvement internationally was to be part of the Canadian team proposal for Medinfo 95 in Vancouver. The IMIA Board decided that since it had not had a South American Medinfo, it would be good for a South American Medical Informatics Society to organize and hold the conference. This was a typical conflict for IMIA: deciding upon a site that would meet the mission of IMIA to promote Medical Informatics worldwide vs. finding a site for Medinfo that would be the primary revenue generator for the next three years of IMIA operations. In this cycle, the site first selected was S\u00e3o Paulo, but  for a number of reasons, including the hyperinflation afflicting the country at the time, it had to be withdrawn. The Canadian proposal was still viable at this stage, so Vancouver was selected next. I was pleased to be asked to be the Treasurer of that conference. It was deemed to be very successful and was very rewarding for the great number of people who worked hard to make it a success. It was also most rewarding financially for IMIA, and a major part of that success was due to the experienced organizational skills of the late Steven Huesing, who was a major pioneer and leader in COACH. For a number of years, I was on the Audit Committee of IMIA, later becoming its chair for several years. This was not an onerous task and was a way to see how IMIA has progressed over the years. From the business point of view, it seems our field has always faced the challenges of increasing demands for innovation, while under a great deal of direction and constraint from regulatory agencies, which have a controlling effect on the market. YCHS, now called YMS, continues to make its way, even though larger public companies are making their presence felt. My hours are reduced, as I have passed on many responsibilities to our children Adam and Andria. I look after the finances, and together we enjoy the challenges of the industry and working with experienced long- term staff. ", "Sherrilynne Fuller": "Professor Emeritus, Department of Biomedical Informatics School of Medicine, University of Washington Seattle, Washington A high school interest in the information science of biology and medicine (particularly taxonomy) was forged during a discussion with my father in high school when I lamented that I wanted to go to medical school but had no stomach for blood. He suggested that I consider combining my love of libraries and books with S. Fuller, MLS, PhD medicine. After pre-med studies at Indiana University (IU), I completed a master\u2019s degree in library and information science at IU. The Vietnam War intervened and prevented continuing graduate studies at that time. After several years living on a variety of military bases in the US and in the Azores, Portugal teaching and working in libraries, I accepted my dream job in 1972\u2014an information analyst position at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) in the Brain Information Service, a combined program of the Brain Research Institute and the UCLA Biomedical Library. Using PDP-11 computers, I contributed to the development of software and tools (including thesauri) to produce alerts for a number of current publications for neuroscientists across the world. The research areas included a variety of rapidly developing central nervous systems science domains including neurotransmitters, neurocorrelates of memory, learning, and sleep in collaboration with leading UC neuroscientists. As information analysts, we worked closely with scientists to understand their research interests and their information needs. A particular interest of mine was in how scientists develop their hypotheses for the logical \u201cnext study.\u201d Attendance at scientific meetings, including those of the Society for Neuroscience, and responsibility for creating proceedings from those meetings furthered my understanding of the information challenges facing researchers at this time when print indexes were their only literature search tools. At the time, Vanevar Bush\u2019s seminal 1945 article \u201cAs We May Think\u201d provided the \u201choly grail\u201d for information scientists. Although we have in many ways, in the succeeding years, realized his dream, there continue to be many challenges facing us in getting the right information (no more nor less) to the right person at the right time. I found those challenges fascinating at the beginning of my career, and for the remainder of my career I have pursued relevant research. After a move to the University of Southern California, as Associate Director of the Norris Medical Library, I encountered a biostatistician, Dr. John Weiner, who was working on challenges related to analyzing and mapping research findings for the Children\u2019s Cancer Study Group, a large national clinical trials collaborative. I began working with Dr. John Weiner and his team and, with his encouragement, I sought out a PhD program relevant to my research interests. I applied and was accepted to the USC library and information science program which encouraged interdisciplinary research and had linkages to the USC Information Sciences Institute. Combining information science, linguistics, medicine, and biology, my PhD thesis explored schema theory in the analysis and representation of text. In collaboration with John and other graduate  students, we developed software to support the analysis and representation of research methods and findings from cancer clinical trials. While computer-assisted visualization tools were very rudimentary at this time (1984), we hypothesized, and later were proven correct, that the time would come when it would be possible to identify and map research findings to potentially identify previously undiscovered links between findings, the field now known as literature-based discovery. Although opportunities for a full-time research career existed, I recognized that administrative responsibilities for libraries might also provide me with a \u201claboratory\u201d for my research interests. My first position as library director was at the Biomedical Library at the University of Minnesota (1984), where Dr. Lael Gatewood, one of the early visionaries in medical informatics, became one of my mentors and introduced me to a variety of new research and development areas, including a regional public health records linkage project, a state-wide cancer surveillance system, and laboratory information systems. In addition, Dr. Gatewood was leading a training program in health informatics and invited me to become a faculty member in the program. I had the opportunity to teach and work with a number of her graduate students and faculty colleagues including Dr. Don Connelly. One of the key problems facing the Biomedical Library at that time was responding to increasing demand for online access to the medical literature. At a time of clunky 1200 baud dial-up modems providing costly access to the NLM Medline database, clinicians and researchers were clamoring for \u201cfree\u201d and \u201cunlimited\u201d access to the online medical literature database. In collaboration with the School of Medicine\u2019s computing group, and faculty advisers including Lael Gatewood, the Biomedical Library developed a locally available online subset of the Medline database, \u201cMinne-Medline\u201d\u2014 Minnesota Medline, one of the first examples of a university offering such access outside NLM (SUNY Albany was the earliest). The system, while somewhat limited in date coverage, proved extremely popular with faculty and offered me extremely useful practical experience in systems design and implementation In 1988, I was invited to apply for and eventually accepted the position of Director, Health Sciences Library, University of Washington. The position interested me because it included responsibility as Director for the National Library of Medicine\u2013funded Regional Medical Library, Pacific Northwest with multistate responsibility for developing libraries and information services as well as offering the opportunity to lead the development of a plan for integrating the disparate academic and medical information systems across the six schools and two hospitals of the UW Health Sciences Center. At this time, automation of clinical information systems consisted of stand-alone databases, each with its own terminal for accessing content. The lack of consistency among records and resulting inefficiency caused widespread frustration and complaints among clinical and administrative staff alike. As the then-Vice President for Health Sciences Dr. Jack Lein said: \u201cThere must be a better way; let\u2019s find it!!\u201d We created a health sciences\u2013wide planning process that asked the key question: \u201cIn 10 years, what would you LIKE to be able to do with clinical and health sciences (academic) information that you can\u2019t do now?\u201d That very productive process resulted in IAIMS (Integrated Academic Information Systems)\u2013funding from the National Library of Medicine in 1990. The path towards today\u2019s \u201cinteroperability\u201d among systems, while not articulated as such, began with the recognition based in our planning process that it was vital to create a \u201cuniform graphical user interface\u201d which could bring together on a single screen the applications which currently existed in separate databases viewed on separate terminals. The interface allowed the information from the disparate databases to appear to the user to be  integrated, preparing for the time when true integration and eventually interoperability became possible. From the UW IAIMS program came MINDSCAPE, considered one of the first web-based clinical information systems, first deployed in 1995. MINDSCAPE brought together in a single user interface multiple sources of patient information including pharmacy, laboratory, radiology, billing, pathology, as well as digital knowledge resources (the UW Health Sciences Library Federated Drug Reference), Medline, etc. A critical component underpinning the successful linkages among applications and databases was the creation of a clinical data dictionary. In addition to critical health information systems development, the IAIMS program at UW over the 10 years of NLM support also provided the impetus for the establishment of an academic home for informatics faculty. In 1997, the Division of Biomedical Informatics, Department of Medical Education, School of Medicine was established. With an initial faculty of eleven, I had the privilege of serving as the first head of the Division, which eventually became the Department of Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education, a large, internationally recognized leader in biomedical informatics training and research. An opportunity to return to my early research interest in schema therapy for representing and mapping research findings came when I was invited to participate in a biology of aging research program, specifically in the area of literature-based knowledge discovery. Telemakus, the system developed to demonstrate the application of the schema theory interface, provided dynamic maps of extracted research findings to graphically display what is known as well as, through gaps in the map, what is yet to be tested. While other research had demonstrated that aggregating and analyzing research findings across domains augments knowledge discovery, the Telemakus system was unique in combining informative document representations with visually dynamic concept maps of linked relationships across groups of research reports. In recent years, I have had the good fortune to teach and do research in a variety of international settings from Africa to South America to Southeast Asia, applying lessons learned (both how to do as well as how NOT to do) across my career. My work has included contributing to the long-term development and teaching of an informatics component of an HIV/AIDS fellows training program (University of Nairobi) as well as contributions to the development of national health information systems (Ministries of Health of Tanzania and of Namibia; Department of Health South Africa). Lessons learned from my work on health information systems over the years include the critical importance of people and organizational processes\u2014i.e. sole focus on the technical aspects of system development does not turn out well in any part of the world. In particular, I am proud to have helped the development of an undergraduate training program in public health informatics at the Hanoi School of Public Health as well as two regional health informatics graduate training and research programs at Mahidol University in Bangkok, Thailand and at Cayetano-Heredia University in Lima, Peru. The Mahidol program trains graduate students from across Southeast Asia and the Cayetano Program accepts students from across the Andean region. The value of health informatics training programs to leadership in health programs is particularly well demonstrated by the Cayetano-Heredia program. Several graduates of the Cayetano-UW graduate training program in health informatics played key roles in the Ministry of Health of Peru. One of the most important lessons I have learned from my work in informatics across the world is the similarities among students, faculty, researchers, and institutions. The commonalties in needs and interests and challenges greatly outweigh the differences. This underscores the importance and value of IMIA in connecting health informatics communities and scholars across the world. ", "Reed M. Gardner (1937 - 2020)": "BS, Electrical Engineering PhD, Biophysics and Bioengineering Developer, HELP Clinical Decision Support System Prof. & Chairman, Dept. of Clinical Informatics, Univ. of Utah President, American Medical Informatics Association My inspiration to become involved in the field of Bio Medical Health Informatics (BMHI) began as a small boy. I grew up in Southern Utah, near Zion Canyon National Park. My father was a sheep rancher and had high expectations for my education. As I completed my high school education math and chemistry became key topics of interest. I graduated from Dixie Junior College in St. George, UT in 1957. Then I attended the University of Utah School of Engineering studying in Electrical Engineering. In 1958 and 1959, I was a summer intern at Hewlett-Packard (HP) in Palo Alto, CA. The HP experience, developing high quality electronic measurement instrumentation, gave me confidence. During my Senior year in Electrical Engineering, I had planned to take a job offer at HP and move to California. However, in January of 1960, Dr. Robert Stephenson, my senior professor, suggested that I should meet Dr. Homer R. Warner at LDS Hospital\u2014he had some medical engineering and analog computing activities that might be of interest. Fellow student Sanford Topham and I went with Prof. Stephenson and met Dr. Warner. What an exciting exchange for all of us. Quickly we were involved in projects using analog computers and sophisticated medical techniques to model cardiovascular function. My first major publication was in 1961 in Electrical Engineering entitled \u201cAnalog computer simulates heart response to nerve stimulation.\u201d The activity took data from Dr. Warner\u2019s earlier work at LDS Hospital and Mayo Clinic to better quantitatively understand how vagal and sympathetic nerve stimulation regulated heart rate. Within weeks, we became deeply involved in the development of computer models of cardiovascular function. The advantage of \u201cmixing\u201d electrical engineering and computers with medicine was clear. Soon both Topham and I became graduate students in Electrical Engineering working toward PhD degrees! Since we were students in such a new field, it became clear to Dr. Warner that as engineers we needed to have training in medicine. He suggested we take a course in physiology. So, we registered for an undergraduate physiology course. When Dr. Warner found out, he said, \u201cNO, you need to take the physiology course with the medical students!\u201d As engineers, we had not taken pre-med courses, and the Chair of the Physiology Department would only allow us into the Medical School Physiology Course if we also took neuroanatomy and biochemistry courses with the medical students. Those courses, especially biochemistry, were difficult, since we had not taken organic chemistry. However, the integration of \u201cengineers\u201d with medical students was a key step in our \u201cinformatics\u201d training. We became peers with the medical students. The med students loved the fact that their engineering colleagues could set up and operate the instrumentation needed to carry out the biochemistry and physiology experiments. In retrospect, Dr. Warner was clearly a visionary and got us involved in what became \u201cmedical informatics\u201d at a very early phase of our careers\u2014even before digital computers were common!  I was motivated primarily by Dr. Warner, with his innovative mind and vision of how computers and quantitative medicine could improve clinical practice. My motivation was strengthened by involvement in the clinical operations of the heart catheterization laboratory, enabling me to watch and learn as physicians made diagnoses and \u201crepaired\u201d heart problems in the operating room. It was one of the first computerized heart catheterization laboratories in the world, as well as one of the first computerized Intensive Care Units (ICUs). I was involved in the day-by-day operation of the computer systems and built hardware and software to help solve real problems. One of the first \u201cclinical\u201d challenges I faced was in applying Dr. Warner\u2019s PhD dissertation\u2014estimating cardiac output from the arterial pressure waveform measured at the aorta. The process required insertion of a long thin plastic tube (catheter) into the radial artery and feeding it into the area of the aorta. With the assistance of Sorenson Research here in Salt Lake City, we developed a disposable Teflon catheter in a shield used to insert the catheter simply, safely, and efficiently without having to take the patient to the operating room. Unfortunately, even with a Teflon catheter, there was clotting and the pressure measuring system was unreliable. So, I applied my engineering knowledge and developed a \u201ccontinuous flush\u201d system to prevent the catheter from clotting. The flush device is still used millions of times each year to provide highly reliable and safe pressure measurements to this day. Part of the apparatus allowed one to optimize the \u201cdynamic response\u201d of the system to minimize pressure wave distortion. Involvement in the heart catheterization laboratory and the ICU gave me the opportunity to develop computerized methods for gathering data from patients. There were few hardware devices to gather and integrate electrocardiograms and blood pressure signals. So we actually developed and built some of the first bedside patient monitors. One of the first automated ICU\u2019s was developed at LDS Hospital in the 1960\u2019s. Even today, many such systems present heart rate and blood pressure results on a display, and then those are selected by a nurse or physician and manually entered into the computerized record. My initial expectation was to use analog computers to simulate the effects of sympathetic and vagus nerve innervation to the heart. The entire process of collecting data from experimental animals and then using that data to better understand the physiology in a dynamic time-critical way was innovative, informative, and novel. As a consequence, I was excited by the project and as an engineer and a \u201cfledgling\u201d medical informaticist\u2014though the term had not yet been invented\u2014found the work very rewarding. My work toward my PhD dissertation involved measuring the pulsatile diameter of the aorta using video signal from a fluoroscope in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Radiopaque dye was injected into the aorta of the experimental animals and the pulsatile border movement was detected using analog and digital computing methods. In addition, detecting \u201cborders\u201d of the aorta to make estimates of the elasticity of the aorta were new and novel concepts. My PhD dissertation was published in 1967 in Volume 1 Issue 1 of the new medical informatics publication entitled Computers and Biomedical Research. Dr. Homer R. Warner was the first editor and served for 27 years! Based on this work, one might ask why I didn\u2019t go into image processing. The main reason was that at that same time, I was involved in computerizing data acquisition and charting in ICUs. At the time, open heart and cardiovascular surgery were new and proved to be very successful and important in resolving heart problems. Care of the critically ill patient after open heart surgery was challenging and exciting. Quickly, I came to understand why Dr. Warner had insisted that we take medical school  physiology as a background for our informatics work. I was able to communicate and work with clinicians, both \u201cintensivists\u201d and surgeons, in a very efficient and effective manner. It quickly became apparent that the computerized record also required information from the clinical laboratory, pharmacy, nursing, transfusion services, and medical imaging. Being able to collect all of this data in a prompt and accurate form was challenging. Since the ICU provided one of our first applications of computerized decision support, it was important that the data collected be coded so that it could be used for computerized decision support. That work eventually resulted in the development of the Health Evaluation through Logical Processing (HELP) system for which LDS Hospital became internationally recognized. Investigators at Beth Israel Hospital developed a computerized blood-gas interpretive method. Their work motivated the development of a similar interpretive scheme at LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City. Further, it became essential to display information in the ICU to physicians caring for the patients in an \u201cintegrated rounds report.\u201d Such work was essential and involved teamwork between physicians, nurses, and informaticists. I presented several tutorial sessions at the annual American Medical Informatics Association meetings on ICU Computerization. In the process, I always presented a slide which stated, \u201cOur work is 80% sociology and 20% technical,\u201d and noted the numbers may really be 90% to 10%. It is because of the active and effective interaction of informaticists with clinical experts that we were able to contribute to important advances in the field. I was involved in the early development of educational programs for \u201cinformatics\u201d students at the University of Utah. Many of the early students were engineers and computer scientists. The original \u201cinformatics\u201d educational program at Utah was established in July 1964 (one of the first in the world), called the Department of Biophysics and Bioengineering and was affiliated with the School of Engineering. In 1972, the department moved to the School of Medicine and was renamed Medical Biophysics and Computing. In 1985, the name was changed to Medical Informatics and most recently in 2006, to Biomedical Informatics. Homer Warner served as Chair for 32 years. I followed as Chair for 9 years, and Joyce Mitchell served as Chair for over 7 years. During that time more than 160 PhD degrees were granted and over 200 MS degrees were awarded. My first experiences in BMHI were in the field developing hardware to acquire physiological data. Initial use of digital computers when I began my \u201cinformatics\u201d work was based on small computer circuit cards with resistors and transistors on then. The typical computer interface was a teletype. So to begin our work in the heart catheterization laboratory, ICU, and anesthesia, we built our own \u201ccomputer terminals\u201d. After initial work in clinical medicine, it became apparent that computerized decision support would be an essential element in improving medicine. As a result, I became involved not only in automated data acquisition but computerized decision support. As a consequence of these activities, questions were asked about the effectiveness of these systems. So, a major change came when I worked to evaluate the effect of these systems. The basic question was \u201cSo what?\u201d\u2014we can do many things with computers but, how much good do we do? Those questions still need to be asked today. As noted in my 2016 IMIA Yearbook article, there are still many challenges and opportunities to improve clinical information systems. In my opinion, measuring the impact of what we do is one of the most difficult and important tasks we as informaticists still have to accomplish.  Other experiences in BMHI also had a dramatic effect on how I was involved in \u201ccommunity service\u201d. In addition to my professional development and publication record, I have had marvelous opportunities to work with colleagues on Grant Review committees, as an Editor of the Journal of Clinical Monitoring, and as President of the Utah Heart Association and the Utah Lung Association. In addition, I served on the Board of Directors of AMIA, chaired one of its Annual Meetings, and was President for one year. For me, these activities were a modest \u201cgive back\u201d for what I have learned from others who have served the informatics and medical community and helped move the field forward. Social connections and relationships have been essential to most of the contributions I have made to the field of BMHI. Dr. Homer Warner quickly assimilated me and our faculty as professional colleagues. He introduced us to his clinical colleagues, and those people accepted us as collaborating professionals. Consequently, I was comfortable with my engineering, computer science, genetics, and clinical colleagues. The most essential feature was to become colleagues, which has not changed much over the years. Clearly the ability to communicate and exchange information and share data has dramatically improved, which has helped all of us. International interactions have been a part of my entire career. In 1969, I joined Dr. T. Allan Pryor and installed an automated heart catheterization system at the Kinderklinik in Kiel in northern Germany. My interaction with colleagues in Holland provided stimulating and important contributions to the field of critical care monitoring and system development. More recently, while Chair of the University of Utah Department of Medical Informatics, we had the opportunity to participate multiple times with the International Partnership in Health Informatics Education (IPHIE), providing a marvelous opportunity for colleagues in Europe, the United States, and more recently Asia to gather with highly qualified and enthusiastic students to better understand the field of informatics. In addition, I have had the opportunity to serve on faculty committees for graduate students at Utah who were from Europe and Asia. The process and interaction provided me with an excellent opportunity to interact and publish with these bright and motivated students. The field of informatics is truly an international field, and IMIA\u2019s publication of their Yearbook provides a timely and excellent worldwide view of our field. From my 2016 perspective I see the following opportunities for further development of Clinical Information Systems: 1. Such systems must provide tools to help minimize adverse care events. 2. Clinical Informatics must integrate its innovations into clinical practice. 3. Healthcare Systems developers must evaluate the effectiveness of their systems. 4. Vendors and Healthcare System developers must acquire and maintain the clinical knowledge needed for computerized decision support, and 5. Governmental and technical standards for informatics systems must be dramatically improved. ", "Tony Gorry (1941 \u2013 2018)": "After graduating from Yale in 1962, I entered the doctoral program in chemical engineering at the University of California at Berkeley. But I soon realized that engineering was not for me. So I took a masters degree in 1963 and enrolled in the Sloan School of Management at MIT. A summer job at MIT's Project MAC finally set me on the path that led to my engagement with biomedical informatics. The Project, established a year earlier, was the Project on Mathematics and Computation, although MAC was later variously taken as multiple access computer, machine-aided cognition, and man and computer. These latter designations suggested the emerging interplay of people and computers, a subject that appealed to me. So I left the Sloan School to seek a doctorate in computer science. There was, however, no department of computer science at MIT in 1963, so my doctoral program was interdepartmental, forged from coursework in operations research, artificial intelligence, and electrical engineering. I received a doctorate in computer science in 1967, the first year in which MIT awarded such a degree. For my thesis, I was drawn to the problem of diagnosis. How does the mechanic, the plumber, the physician decide what is defective or malfunctioning when unexpected behavior appears? Clearly the expert has knowledge gained from previous encounters, strategies for gathering current information, and methods of reasoning that meld the two. In some cases, explicit theories may be at hand to facilitate diagnostic problem solving. These considerations helped shape my thesis proposal and research, which soon focused on medical decision making. Then I was working in artificial intelligence, where despite computers that were puny by today\u2019s standards, ambitions were quite grand. Mine was to create a program that would perform as well as an expert clinician. But how? The mental processes of physicians seemed mysterious, and watching physicians work revealed little about how they thought. They themselves generally attributed their skills to an inexplicable intuition, a product of long experience. Fifty years ago, intuition lay outside the realm of computing. It still does today. So with help from physician colleagues\u2014first Octo Barnett, then Jerome Kassirer and William Schwartz\u2014I set out to find an \u201cunderstanding\u201d of aspects of medicine in numbers (probabilities and utilities) that allowed reasoning by calculation, which suited the computer well. My colleagues prepared tables of subjective estimates of conditional probabilities for signs and symptoms across sets of diseases. They also offered a priori probabilities of the diseases in question. The challenge for the program was to find an \u201cefficient\u201d sequence of questions to reach a conclusion (with high likelihood) of the underlying disease in a given case. Various heuristics guided the selection of questions. Readers of this book will quickly sense Bayes\u2019s rule at work here. And they will note the simplification of medical diagnosis. But in a surprise to many physicians, the  program matched their decision making in several medical areas. Two different ways of thinking, intuitive and computational, arrived at the same conclusions. In the years that followed, with Kassirer, Schwartz, and then Stephen Pauker, I worked to elaborate the inference engine of the program and its descendants as set forth in a series of publications in medical and informatics journals. Of course, by using medical terms, the program escaped much of the problem of knowledge. It had no understanding of the terms it was using or the named diseases. It might know a number that links nephrotic syndrome to protein in the urine, but it didn\u2019t know breakfast comes before dinner. I wrote about the nature and complexity of this problem, underscoring the need for fundamental research on knowledge representation and use. In this vein, my colleagues and I explored the way in which the taking of the present illness set the stage for diagnosis. How could a computer program \u201ctrigger\u201d the appropriate context from initial clues provided about the patient\u2019s condition? How could hearing something bring something else quickly to mind from a very large knowledge base? We were later to publish a number of descriptions of some interesting models of that process. My program and its descendants hadn\u2019t reasoned like a physician, but with explicit information about clinical choices, they could choose among them by calculation. At the time, my colleagues and I thought that by adopting the program\u2019s methods, called decision analysis, a physician might, in certain complex cases, be better able to balance risks and benefits for the patient. One of the putative virtues of decision analysis is the separation of probabilities of outcomes and the values placed upon them. The physician is the likely authority on the former; the patient on the latter. Decision analysis, therefore, might improve communication and collaboration in difficult cases. This speculation proved correct. As we reported in a series of publications, many doctors found decision analysis a useful adjunct to their natural reasoning about clinical situations. Some used it to explain their reasoning about cases to students and trainees. And, as we reported, through the use of decision analysis, a number of common mistakes in clinical judgment were revealed. To invoke decisions analysis, however, what has been implicit must be made explicit. Probabilities that have been but feelings have to be written down. Assessments of risks have to be made explicit. Years ago, doctors had found it relatively easy to quantify some uncertainties of a clinical situation. In what percentage of cases of a certain disease, for example, does a particular symptom arise? How likely is a given treatment to produce a specified result in a patient with a known disease? Finding numerical values to represent the consequences of treatment, however, proved more challenging. How, for example, can the side effects of a drug be compared to its otherwise positive effect on the patient\u2019s condition? When outcomes seemed incommensurate, however, even partial explication had proved helpful. Doctors who used decision analysis as a more methodical approach to certain difficult cases said it improved their decisions. Yet, for every doctor who found decision analysis helpful, there were others who thought it alien and uncongenial to their ways of thinking about patients and their problems. In time, my research interests turned in other directions, but I maintained a strong connection with medical informatics as the director of a biomedical informatics training program, which the National Library of Medicine continuously funded for 25 years. The program spaned six institutions in Houston: Rice University, the University of Houston, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, and the University of Texas Medical Branch in  Galveston. I retired from Rice and the leadership of the program in June 2016, leaving it with an outstanding track record and in very good hands for future success. About eight years ago, I returned to decision analysis when a hematologist told me I had acute myeloblastic leukemia. I still have the pages on which he scribbled branches, probabilities, and outcomes that suggested the beginnings of the decision analysis my colleagues and I had urged on physicians four decades before. I first thought to apply decision analysis to my choice between continued chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. It was easy to draw a tree with its branches leading to dim prospects. I would assess probabilities and quantify risks and benefits. But how? My doctors were no decision analysts. Instead, they seemed more like members of a learned and priestly class, all wanting the best for me, but sometimes at odds in their reading of omens and foretelling of consequences. I realized from their ruminations that the balancing of a greater prospect of cure against the risk of earlier death was not a task for the mind alone, but for the heart as well. Collectively they had prepared me to face what was less a decision tree than a thicket of facts, opinions, and feelings through which I had to chart a course. My decisions emerged from what I now regard as informed intuition, the interplay of the formal and the subjective, the methodical and the impulsive. Like the physicians from decades ago, I was unable to explain important aspects of my reasoning. How numbers might meld with emotions still remains a mystery to me. But that is fine. In the words of William Bruce Campbell, not everything that counts can be counted. In dire situations, the sketching of choices in terms of probabilities and values should be just the first step in an intimate conversation between doctor and patient. Afterwards, in that exchange, imagination, empathy, and compassion are vital. To be helpful, decision analysis must be expressed in the mysterious human calculus that encompasses not just numbers, but pain and suffering, life and death, as well. Computers and Biomedical Research, 1968; 1:490-507 ", "Andrew Grant": "Professor and Director CRED Collaborative Research for Effective Diagnostics Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke, Quebec I trained in Birmingham oriented toward internal medicine; however, in specialist training I became attracted to chemical pathology/clinical biochemistry and found myself successively for 2 years a Junior Assistant Pathologist followed by 4 years as a clinical lecturer at Cambridge and Oxford Universities, respectively. During this time, I met several well-known scientists including Hans Krebs of Krebs Cycle fame. I also published with my dietician colleague Elisabeth Todd a Handbook of Enteral and Parenteral Nutrition and completed a DPhil studying mechanisms of insulin secretion by isolated islets of Langerhans. Whilst at Cambridge I organised a colloquium on optimising scientific exchange between laboratory and clinical activities which was reported as an editorial in the Lancet. Also interesting is that the old Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital in Cambridge where I worked is now the Judge Business School where my son Tom recently obtained his MBA. I became consultant and lecturer in Chemical Pathology at the University of Leeds in 1983 and recruited to the Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke, Quebec as full professor and head of Clinical Biochemistry in 1989, and I have spent the rest of my career in Sherbrooke in this collegial and innovative environment. This background also explains my increasing interest in Medical Informatics. It was whilst at Cambridge in the Clinical Biochemistry laboratory headed by Professor Herman Lehmann FRS that I was attracted by notions of metabolic pathways, modelling of biochemical data, and patient treatment response as well as judicious use of tests and exploiting the centralised data resource of the laboratory. In Cambridge, I commenced my clinical interest in nutrition and worked with Alan Howard on the Cambridge diet. In 1979, I moved to the Radcliffe Infirmary at Oxford to the Clinical Biochemistry department led by Professor Philip Randle FRS as well as thesis supervisor Dr. Stephen Ashcroft. At this time, I became acquainted with Dr. Dereck Cramp at the Royal Free Hospital, London, a Chemical Pathologist who also had a passion for data modelling and medical informatics, and he invited me to attend a data modelling workshop, which set in motion a process that led to our leading the inauguration of the British Society for Medical Informatics in 1980, now known as the UK Health Informatics Society. Here we promoted that there was a need for better integration of the different sciences that make up Medical Informatics, including clinical care, epidemiology, information sciences, computing sciences, and behavioural sciences. In 1987, I coordinated a successful bid for European Union funding for a multi- disciplinary, multi-country project called TAO, Therapy Advisor for Oncology, which brought together expertise in system engineering, decision support, behavioural sciences, clinical protocols, and medical informatics applications. This was an amazing inter- cultural experience which we took as far as producing a well-defined architecture, but only limited clinical prototyping was possible in the time available.  In 1989, I and my young family emigrated from the UK, recruited to the medical faculty of the University of Sherbrooke, Quebec. Attracted not only by the advanced implementation of the integrated hospital information system, I also embraced the privilege of many conversations with Roger Cot\u00e9, emeritus professor at Sherbrooke and leader of SNOMED development for more than 30 years. SCAMC / AMIA was a key introduction to Medical Informatics\u2014I still have a SCAMC mini-screwdriver. Progressively making new friends, I became a founder leader of the Consumer Health Informatics group in AMIA and well recall the encouragement of Morrie Collen. Another deciding moment was a workshop with William Hersch on online Medical Informatics education which helped me in the design and leadership of a 30-credit online master\u2019s- level Medical Informatics diploma in French for Quebec and internationally. At my induction to FACMI in 2004, mentioning my research interest in effectively bringing new technology into clinical practice, it is noted that I \u2018dubbed\u2019 this translational informatics\u2014maybe one of the first examples of the use of this term! I have also sustained contacts to European and international medical informatics. At a conference on Medical Informatics education in Newcastle, Australia in 1997, I met Reinhold Haux, future president of IMIA, and in 1998 spent a 3-month sabbatical with him at Heidelberg University in Germany. During this time, I was able to contribute to the IMIA health and medical informatics education guidelines being edited by Reinhold. I appreciated the strong relationship at Heidelberg of the department of medical informatics with the clinical services, as well as the strong interaction with the technical university at Heilbronn, and these together introduced me to a very good model for collaborative innovation. At Heidelberg, I met Alfred Winter, Director of Medical Informatics at Leipzig, and learnt of his work on strategic management of health information systems. Through Reinhold, I was introduced to Casimir Kulikowski through stimulating scientific exchange and visits, Rutgers not being too far from Sherbrooke. Being from a French-speaking university in Quebec, I attended the biannual francophone medical informatics conference JFIM (Journ\u00e9es francophones d'informatique m\u00e9dicale) in Li\u00e8ge in 1998. Here I became acquainted with several French leaders in medical informatics and became aware of the influential pioneering work of Fran\u00e7ois Gr\u00e9my bringing medicine and informatics together. I proposed that the 2002 JFIM should take place for the first time in Quebec; the conference had 250 participants from many francophone countries, including from Africa. The society Soqibs\u2014Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise d'Informatique Biom\u00e9dicale et de la Sant\u00e9\u2014was created, and I became the first president. JFIM 2007 took place in Bamako, Mali, and subsequently relationships with Mali have continued including cooperation in online learning in medical informatics. In 2009, I spent a month at the Medical Centre for Information and Analysis at Moscow, presenting at the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. Another major international interest has been the use of standards in Medical Informatics. I have participated in the Infoway Canada standards development in different ways, including co-chair of the Standards Steering Committee 2004-2006. I served 2007-2011 on the Technology Committee of the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization (IHTSDO) for Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT). I have also been a Canadian delegate to the International Standards Organisation Technical Committee for Health Informatics TC 215 since 2002, including leading the documents TR 22221, \u201cGood principles and practices for a clinical datawarehouse\u201d in 2006; TS 29585, \u201cDeployment  of a clinical datawarehouse\u201d in 2010, now translated into Portuguese; and TR 13054, \u201cKnowledge management of health information standards\u201d in 2012. My group hosts the health informatics glossary for TC 215, and increasingly for other organisations, at www.skmtglossary.org. However, my research interest has consistently been how to improve informatics at the research\u2013clinical interface. Our early ideas were published in the International Journal of Medical Informatics in 1998 under the title: \u201cUse of evidence in the process of practice change in a clinical team: a study forming part of the Autocontrol project.\u201d These ideas fit with the current emphasis on the learning organisation. At the time, I was also education leader in a Canada-wide National Centres of Excellence program during the period 1995-2002. This program was called HEALNet\u2014Health Evidence Application and Linkage Network\u2014with a broad agenda; the invaluable chance to meet new colleagues, including Jochen Moehr at Victoria, BC and Brian Haynes at McMaster; and the opportunity to link to Medical Informatics across the country. We continued to develop these ideas, including my leading an investment in a clinical datawarehouse for the hospital in 2004, which serves evaluative research in different ways. In parallel, we have developed a network of 35 heart failure clinics that are used in the clinical encounter and enable a shared database for research purposes. We also have a very flexible web-based platform for clinical research studies. Significant strides are being made in all of these areas, but what is most exciting is that now we are beginning to get health information integration across levels of care and into the community. Our region has a very stable population. We are aiming to support longitudinal care, decision making, practice review, technology assessment, and innovation in a unified organisation, and it now seems that this dream will become reality in the not too distant future. ", "Robert A. Greenes": "Professor & Former Chair, Department of Biomedical Informatics, Arizona State University Former Professor of Biomedical Informatics, Harvard University My personal odyssey towards informatics began as a University of Michigan college senior in 1961 en route to medical school at Harvard the following year. Taking a course in computer science in my last semester totally upended my goals for going into medicine \u2013 I committed myself from that point on to see how my new fascination with computing could be combined with my planned goal of becoming a doctor. I arrived in Boston in Spring, 1962, seeking to learn about anyone working with computers at Harvard or at its hospitals. The Dean\u2019s office referred me to Murray Eden, a professor at MIT, who introduced me to Dr. Frank Ervin, a psychiatry professor at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Frank was studying the vision pathways of Rhesus monkeys by embedding electrodes in the lateral geniculate body and optical cortex and examining the signal propagation, frequencies, and transfer functions at various junctures. I was given the job of developing an auto/cross-correlation and Fourier transform/power spectrum analysis program on a Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC) PDP-4 computer in machine language (using a primitive assembler). I completed this task, producing a system we called Oxnard, which was subsequently used in the lab. I also had the fortune of working for Steve Lorch, an employee of Frank\u2019s who was launching a service to provide statistical analysis for researchers at MGH, and I wrote several statistical software packages, running them via batch processing using punch card decks, at the MIT Computing Center, work that helped to put me through medical school. I learned a great deal, largely self-taught in those first three years, and met Dr. Octo Barnett in 1965, when he was recruited to MGH from the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital to run the Hospital Computer Project (HCP) at MGH, in the Laboratory of Computer Science (LCS), of which he became the director. The HCP was one of the world\u2019s first hospital automation projects, funded at approximately $1M per year (in 1965 dollars!). The system was being implemented through a large subcontract to Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN), on one of the world\u2019s first time-sharing computers, a DEC PDP-1, using assembly language programming. The BBN effort was led by Dr. Jordan Baruch. This project was a tremoundous effort, with ambitions to automate the admission/discharge/transfer, laboratory reporting, medication order entry, nursing activities and tracking, and other functions, using initially 10-character-per-second teletypes connected by hardwired twisted-pair wire throughout the hospital, and with a 5 MB hard disk. Needless to say, the initial optimism proved to be unwarranted, and the project was proceeding slowly. Also, the interaction of the technical development staff with the users was primitive, and any minor request for modification, say, of an interactive dialogue, required approximately a 2-week turnaround. After meeting Octo, I began working in the LCS as a medical student and used the lab as a base for doing a medical student honors thesis on computer-based medical interviewing, called GUIDE. I used the SLIP tools for list processing developed by MIT  Prof. Joseph Weizenbaum to implement the project, on another one of the first time- sharing systems, the CTSS system of MIT\u2019s Project MAC. Following my MD degree, I took the unorthodox step of going on for a PhD in computer science at Harvard, while also serving as Octo\u2019s first clinical postdoctoral fellow at MGH and getting a stipend for my degree program through the National Institutes of Health. There was no department of CS yet at Harvard, so this concentration was offered through the Division of Engineering and Applied Science as part of a degree in Applied Mathematics. I had great flexibility in the program in also being able to freely cross-register for courses in other Harvard schools, including a course on the new field of decision science taught by Prof. Howard Raiffa. The introductory computer science course was taught in LISP by Prof. Dan Bobrow. I also took courses in operations research, microeconomics, and other topics at MIT. As I started work on my PhD in 1966, BBN had put up on their PDP-1 time-sharing system an algebraic interpreter called TELECOMP, modeled after a language developed at RAND Corp. called JOSS, around the same time that the BASIC language was being made available on mainframe computers at Dartmouth. I began exploring TELECOMP and a successor called STRINGCOMP, which enabled some text processing as well as algebraic computation, as a possible basis for my patient interviewing project and towards a more ambitious goal of being able to capture doctors\u2019 notes in structured form. Working with two engineers that Octo had brought with him from the Brigham, Neil Pappalardo and Curt Marble, we began using the PDP-4 computer that was also brought from Octo\u2019s cardiovascular lab at the Brigham, and which was upgraded to a PDP-7, to create a similar capability on this computer. At the time, various other time-sharing systems were emerging, and Neil and I site-visited the University of California Berkeley, UCLA, and System Development Corp., maker of the SDS 940 computer. While traveling, we began fleshing out the idea of \u201cglobal arrays\u201d as a way of accessing patient data\u2014sparse hierarchical arrays that only allocated storage for elements actually used, and an interpreter with algebraic and string processing capabilities that could operate on these arrays as well as similar local structures. We also learned that Jordan Baruch of BBN was creating a new company MEDNET funded by General Electric and exploring a similar idea in a system which they called FILECOMP, but we did not have details of that. These concurrent activities influenced our decisions about the design features for our system. I take the dubious credit for the name for our system, which we called MUMPS. I remember that several of us were standing in the secretary\u2019s office outside of Octo\u2019s office waiting to see him, and we started playing around with MEASLES as an acronym, and I suggested MUMPS. We all had a laugh over that and thought of lots of puns and reasons not to use it, but somehow it stuck. Another engineer in the LCS, Peter Katona, implemented a prototype of a clinical laboratory information system in MUMPS. This exploration paid off\u2014based on its success, Octo took the risky step in 1967 of applying for a renewal of the Hospital Computer Project grant, this time without BBN and their assembly-language-based development team, to do all implementation in this new homegrown system. I remember well the NIH site visit in 1967 that reviewed this proposal. The site visitors were Don Lindberg, Homer Warner, Morris Collen, Carlos Vallbona, Carol Newton, and Max Woodbury. Needless to say, the project was approved. Our first paper describing MUMPS was published in 1969 in Homer Warner\u2019s journal, Computers and Biomedical Research.  We designed MUMPS in part to be able to fine-tune user interaction (UI) experiences, as much as we could with the character-based displays of those days. Design considerations for MUMPS became one of the chapters of my doctoral thesis (which was the basis for the CBMR paper). My doctoral thesis used the new MUMPS system to provide a structured interface for physician entry of progress notes. We pasted aluminum strips to a Raytheon CRT screen face, connected to a capacitance circuit. There was commentary on getting a \u201cbuzz\u201d when one touched the screen on a humid day. Actually, the reverse also occurred\u2014on certain days you had to lick your finger to be able to make contact\u2014I hate to think what the bacterial culture of the screen surface was like after this! With the touch-wire displays, we were, of course, trying to tackle the difficult problem of capturing progress notes with structured input. This was happening in the days when people were beginning to become aware of Larry Weed\u2019s POMR concept, and we reported our work as a New England Journal of Medicine paper in 1970. I worked later with Drs. Henry Pendergrass and then Roger Bauman on applying this approach also to radiology report entry. It is instructive to realize that even with our vastly improved technology these days, this still presents a daunting problem. Those early years were personally exciting, given the unusual and possibly risky trajectory I was undertaking, in veering from the typical pathway of internship and residency following medical school in order to become a medical practitioner. I have enormous gratitude to Octo for his openness to new ideas and willingness to provide a research home to young folks like myself who wanted to pursue our dreams. I was also fortunate in being able to craft a PhD program to include many topics of interest to me, with the support of wonderful mentors, including Octo, Anthony Oettinger, William Bossert, and Joseph Weizenbaum as members of my doctoral committee. I ended up with a degree program that foreshadowed a curriculum we have since developed for biomedical informatics, drawing on and fashioned from not only computer science and applied mathematics, but also statistics, decision science, and systems engineering\u2014the term \u201cinformatics\u201d did not even come into existence for almost another decade. I may have been the first person to have combined training as both an MD and a PhD in computer science and related fields. ", "Piet C. de Groen": "MD, Professor of Medicine Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition Department of Medicine University of Minnesota Medical informatics, by chance Life is unpredictable. I never imaged that I would work most of my life in the US, and definitely not working on medical informatics projects or contributing to projects of others, some of whom I would only meet long after we connected via the internet and worked together for one or more years. Yet that is exactly what has happened, and by chance. The first important event that prepared me for a career in informatics was probably a typing class I took as a high school student. It must have been in the late sixties or early seventies; I was growing up in a little town in the east of the Netherlands and it was mainly girls who were taking typing classes in preparation for secretarial positions later in life. If I remember correctly, there was only one other boy in the typing class. We were both nerds. Anyway, it was a time when I wanted to learn anything I could learn, so I learned to \u201ctype blind\u201d at a decent speed on one of those old-fashioned heavy manual typewriters. An elective class in high school that unknowingly prepared me for informatics was advanced mathematics, which in our high school was an optional class. I really liked the teacher and I thought that it would be good to know a lot about mathematics as by that time I had more or less decided that I was going to study medicine. Eleven boys, mostly nerds, out of a class of about 150, graduated after two years studying this subject; I think we all ended up studying STEM topics at various universities in the Netherlands. The third fortuitous circumstance leading me towards informatics was a research project I had to complete as part of my medical training at the University of Nijmegen. Because I had thoroughly enjoyed my clerkship in medicine, mostly on the ward of the Division of Gastroenterology, I decided to look into a possible project in this specialty. There was a laboratory-based project that required the collection of the serum of patients with Crohn\u2019s disease\u2014an inflammatory disease mostly effecting the ileum and colon\u2014 followed by manual radial immune diffusion assays. A predefined volume of diluted or undiluted patient serum was added to a well in an agar plate containing specific antibodies to C-reactive protein or orosomucoid and the plate incubated to allow proteins to diffuse into the agar. Only proteins recognized by the antibodies cause a radial precipitate; the radius from the precipitate was measured on a light box. A series of increasing amounts of standard protein solution describe the standard curve against which unknown concentrations can be measured. Every day I was supposed to calculate the standard curves (manually by calculator), and then based on the curves, the concentration of unknown samples in duplicate or triplicate (again manually). I knew that there were, even then, computers that could do this automatically and spare me the tedium of repetition. The Faculty of Medicine did not have any, but the Faculty of Science had two computers which were housed in the University Computing Center. The  most advanced computer was an IBM System 360 with 32 MB RAM shared among all university staff and students. One needed to learn how to write a program, and then punch the code on punch cards, card by card, line by line. However, there were a couple of new \u201cterminals\u201d sitting unused on a desk next to the punch card machines. When I saw the monitors and keyboards, I knew that I would never produce a single punch card, because I could type! I also found out that there was a text editor that allowed word processing\u2014 1-2 character codes preceded by a dot at the beginning of an 80-character line provided formatting information that was interpreted by editing software, producing results in a nicely formatted text with chapters, footnotes, etc. I took a course in the basics of computer programming, and learned how to create graphs, standard curves, and all else that was required of me. At this stage, I still had no plans whatsoever to pursue an academic career. However, the Dutch government had different ideas. On December 5, 1975, on St. Nicolas Day (the day that the Dutch give each other presents the way the British and Americans do on Christmas), I received a post card. It said that that I no longer had to fulfill the mandatory service in the Dutch army before starting my residency in Family Medicine so as to take over my father\u2019s family practice. But there was a 2-year waiting time for entering my residency. So what was I to do? Serendipity came to the rescue: at a wedding my father suggested I take a ride back to Nijmegen with a gastroenterologist who had just returned from the USA. I went with him, we talked in the car, and he wrote a letter\u2014 and before long I was heading for a year of clinical research at a hospital in Rochester, Minnesota that I found out later was apparently quite famous\u2014the Mayo Clinic. Then, once again a strange twist of fate intervened. The Mayo Clinic had not filed my visa application on time, and suddenly I had nothing to do in the Netherlands for 6 months. At this point, it so happened that a computer science classmate was an administrator in the Department of Radiology; he needed a database to hold all the research data of his department, and ideally with a fail-safe data entry method and some kind of data search engine. There was urgency in this need, because data from the breast cancer screening program in the eastern part of the Netherlands needed to be analyzed. I told him I could do the job if he was willing to take a chance on me. He told me that he was, and in this way, I became the ad hoc programmer for the radiology department. It was an exciting time: I taught myself or got help from others in twelve programming and scripting languages and created an Easytrieve-compatible data repository that could be loaded via a thin client application anywhere in the University. The application, mostly written in PL/I, allowed controlled, structured data (exactly predefined fields) as well as free text (limited character length\u2013only fields) entry of all radiology information for practice and research. I also wrote a query engine using an IBM scripting language allowing targeted data retrieval. Because the Computing Center closed at 6 PM, my progress was slow; but with the help of my administrator colleague, a terminal was installed in the X-ray plate room of the Department of Radiology and connected to the IBM System 360. Suddenly I became the envy of all students, since after 6 PM I had the university mainframe all for myself! This way I was able to make rapid progress and even dabble in modeling and programming 3D reconstructions of the female chest placing observed tumors at their correct anatomical locations. My nightly peace was, however, once disturbed by an elderly gentleman roaming around the plate room. He asked me who I was and what was I doing with that machine in his plate room! It turned out that he was the Chair of Radiology, unaware that his newest employee was building a research system. I completed everything in about 3 months, and for years it was used as the basis for radiology research projects.  When I arrived at the Mayo Clinic in January of 1982, I found nearly everything impressive\u2014but the computer support was rudimentary. During my research years and subsequent fellowships (I ended up spending 9 years in research and clinical fellowships in Rochester), I had to use a system called CLINFO that ran on a DEC PDP-11. Using BASIC, I programmed my own text editor, as I was used to keeping notes on a computer. As part of a Fellowship in Pharmacology, I requested my own terminal; a year later I started a clinical fellowship and brought that terminal into my Mayo Clinic office and examination room. That lasted about 2 months\u2014by then Mayo Clinic committees had become aware of my setup and decided that having a \u201ccomputer terminal in a patient examination room greatly detracts from patient care,\u201d and I had to remove it. Fast forward to today, and you will be unable to find a Mayo Clinic examination room without a computer or a function in patient care that does not depend on and mandate the use of computers! Yet, even after this episode, I still had no plans to get involved in what was becoming known as medical informatics. In 1993, I joined the Mayo Clinic staff with career plans to advance laboratory and clinical research specifically for the early detection of cholangiocarcinoma, a cancer of the bile ducts. I knew this would be difficult, as there were 60 gastroenterologists at Mayo, and the institution saw about 60 patients with cholangiocarcinoma a year. If randomly assigned, this would have meant that every physician on average would just see one patient with this condition per year. Asking them to include that one patient in a research study seemed like a guarantee for failure: physicians have too many other important things to do. So with my computer background, I started looking for a database that would contain diagnostic-related information, but soon discovered that the only reliable and timely database was the one with \u201cbilling records\u201d that contained the diagnostic ICD-9 and CPT codes that were needed to bill for the examinations and procedures. Later I found out why the database was kept up to date\u2014each week sooner that a bill was paid increased the Mayo Clinic\u2019s revenue more than $1 million on an annual basis, motivating them to make the billing records state-of- the-art. I realized that I needed more data for the cancer research study and asked the cancer center for help. Again by lucky chance, the cancer center was looking into a new way to run clinical trials; there had already been about 20 requests. A friend alerted me to a new technology called the World Wide Web (WWW), and as soon as I opened the first web pages on my new color- and graphics-capable terminal, I knew that this was what I needed for my research! With the help of a programmer, I was the first to propose using WWW technology at Mayo. There was solid opposition, but the chairman decided to give us two weeks to convince the committee that our proposal was realistic. We created two pages: the first one asked for a username and a hidden password, and only if both satisfied a valid combination did the second page for data entry appear. Our message was: if we can do two pages, we can do thousands. And that is what happened. The entire Mayo Clinic cancer center clinical trials system was converted to use the World Wide Web. We programmed an API connecting to the laboratory information system so that lab values and corresponding normal values would populate the cancer center databases automatically. By now my interest in informatics had blossomed. I saw the massive waste of effort from hundreds of people manually reviewing clinical charts and copying data from paper printout to computer-based research databases. Diagnoses were being missed because data was not readily available or analyzable. Some of us knew there were better solutions, and these are computer-based. We proposed to do for the entire Mayo Clinic what we had done for the cancer center. However, there was no interest: the research committees  told us that what we were proposing was clinical, while the clinical committees told us it was research. At the same time, IBM created a new division, IBM Healthcare, and was looking for a medical partner to develop new data management tools to support the analysis of information in healthcare. It so happens that IBM had a research and development site in Rochester, MN, about 7 miles from the Mayo Clinic. Together with IBM Rochester, we proposed to develop a database that included all data for all patients, to be called the Mayo Clinic Life Sciences System, and this time we obtained approval from the Mayo Clinic board with $40 million in funding over 5 years. Exciting times then returned. We designed and developed a framework for secure and confidential collection of data from the 6 to 7 million patients with real-time updates. Genomic data were included with the potential to include DNA sequence, tissue, and condition specific- RNA expression data. Ongoing work in natural language processing (NLP) was incorportated and extended to eventually result in cTAKES, which was released as open source software. We built a search engine able to query across structured data and free text, data discovery and query builder (DDQB), allowing highly complex conditional queries. This, then, was a time when the Mayo Clinic was a leader in the medical informatics space with visitors coming from all over the world. I had the privilege to lead these efforts between 2002 and 2007. Since 2001, my main research interest has focused on the quality of endoscopy results, particularly those from colonoscopy. As a specialist in liver diseases, I saw patients with metastatic colon cancer of the liver despite screening for this disease with colonoscopy. Between 1998 and 2018, the US has invested somewhere between $100 and $400 billion into screening for colon cancer, yet in 2018 the same number of patients, about 50,000, continue to die from this disease as was happening in 1998. We know that a colonoscopy of high quality provides excellent protection against colorectal cancer. To study what happens during colonoscopy, colleagues at Iowa State University, the University of North Texas, and I developed the Endoscopic Multimedia Information System (EMIS), which allows automated, real-time video streaming image analysis with real-time feedback. The goal of EMIS is to provide automated feedback when the endoscopy quality is low, stimulating endoscopists to improve their technique, thereby bringing all colonoscopies up to a higher quality, which can significantly decrease false negatives\u2014and thus prevent development of colon cancer. What is currently the main challenge for medical informatics? As a physician, I cannot believe that we still live in a tower of Babel. Many highly heterogeneous and incompatible applications across hospitals and outpatient clinics all somehow need to capture, record, maintain, and analyze the same patient data. In addition, the regulatory and billing focus of current electronic medical records (EMRs) makes it unbelievably difficult and time-consuming to find data or to place an order. I think we need to insist on uniformity of medical data capture and recording so that data become easier to find, understand, share, and compare for clinical and other purposes. And we need to make it user friendly: EMRs designed by and for those who see patients and work daily with the contents. One user friendly EMR for all of healthcare? It need not be a bad solution. ", "W. Ed Hammond": "Director, Duke Center for Health Informatics, Duke Translational Medicine Institute Director, Applied Informatics Research, Duke Health Technology Solutions Professor, Department of Community and Family Medicine, School of Medicine Professor Emeritus, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Pratt School of Engineering Research Professor, Duke School of Nursing Much of my entire career is a result of serendipity. I was fortunate to win a Navy scholarship to Duke, where I majored in Electrical Engineering. While I was serving my 3 years of active duty, Duke established a doctoral program. The head of the department of EE actually enrolled me in the program while I was at sea. Not only that, but I had a job as Instructor. My doctoral research was first in power conversion for spacecraft; then I switched to telemetry, decoding signals from the IMP series of satellites, using correlation. Working with NASA Goddard, I was able to work with the first minicomputer\u2014a Digital Computer Corporation (DEC) 1800. I taught myself FORTRAN programming. As I neared the completion of my studies, Duke decided to create a Department of Biomedical Engineering, and I was invited to join. I received a two-year post-doctoral study award, and I took the first two years of med school. My first projects were just thrusts into the area. One was using correlation and change in impedance to measure cardiac output in astronauts. The other was related to using an analogue computer to calculate cardiac output in the hyperbaric chambers at Duke. Both were fun but did not capture my attention. Other biomedical engineering faculty at Duke were doing research in inverse mapping of cardiac potentials using analogue recordings on tape and transferring the tapes to the Triangle Universities Computation Center where the analysis was performed on a large mainframe computer. In the second year of my studies, serendipity stepped in again. Dr. John Moore, Professor in Physiology at Duke spent his summers at Woods Hole on Cape Cod doing his research. He had acquired a LINC 8 minicomputer, but he could not transport the computer to Woods Hole. So I asked to use the computer over the summer, and he said yes. Doing surfacing mapping on the remote main frame had a number of issues. So I decided to try to duplicate the process on a minicomputer. The LINC 8 was perfect. It supported the capture of analogue inputs, had a display screen, could generate external signals, and could be programmed. I wrote the programs in assembly language and programmed the LINC to trigger a video camera, so I was able to make moving images of the flow of the electrical cardiac signals. In spite of demonstrating the process to the other researchers, they could not believe the system worked. During the final phase of my post-doc, Duke submitted a proposal to develop a multiphasic-screening center at Duke, and I was listed as an Assistant Professor in the proposal. The proposal was not funded, but I became an Assistant Professor in the newly formed Department of Community Health Sciences. I actually was never interviewed for the position, and I never met my Department Chair for 6 weeks. I later learned that my  salary was paid for the first three years by Dr. Eugene Stead. I had to spend an hour every month talking with Dr. Stead about a variety of topics. That relationship continued to develop over time and had a great influence on my career. A byproduct of an aborted attempt by IBM and Duke to develop a Clinical Decision Support System was a screening medical history. That history was converted to a 19- page mark sense form that was scanned and recorded on analogue tape and transported to TUCC for interpretation and printout. Textual data was entered on punched cards. Major problems including getting punched cards, the program deck, and the analogue tape to TUCC at the same time; cost; and time threated the success of the project. I convinced the project leader \u2013 Dr. Tommy Thompson to let me build an interface between the scanner and a DEC PDP 12 that had been a gift to Biomedical Engineering and assigned to me. The interface cost just over $10, text was input through a teletype input and the histories were printed in narrative on teletype paper. The actual cost was pennies, the time was minutes, and we had a successful project. I next started my own group. Serendipity provided me with an outstanding group of five highly intelligent and hardworking young men who were a combination of skills and interest. They were Alton Brantley, Steve Feagin, Steve Lloyd, Bill Stead, and Skip Walter. Mark Straube later joined the group. Each of the individuals had a separate skill and the combination made a powerful team. I won\u2019t include the detail of each person\u2019s contributions, but they were able to produce solutions that were creative and dynamic. Around 1970 Duke had purchased the Burroughs Hospital Information System (HIS). The computer supporting this system was located in Charlotte NC and connected to Duke over telephone wires. It was the tail wagging the dog, and Duke quickly recognized it needed a different system. In the meantime, our group, which had adopted the name Information Science Division (ISD), continued to develop a variant of projects working with researchers in several different clinical areas. I did most of the programming\u2014all in assembly language. I argued and believed that I could program faster and better than anyone could in a programming language such as FORTRAN, COBOL, or PL1. But as we worked with different applications, I found myself copying sections of code from one program into another. One of the group suggested that we make a file of routines that we could call by name to make it easy to reuse code. This approach eventually led to the development of a programming language that we called GEMISCH for GEneralized Medical Information System for Community Health. Duke decided to put out a bid for the new HIS, and we put together a proposal to submit to Duke. We proposed to put a series of PDP-12s throughout Duke, connected together for the HIS. These minicomputers were 12-bit works, with 4K of main memory. We made a presentation on a Saturday morning and gained much support for our proposal. Fortunately, cooler minds stepped forth, but we were awarded funding to develop and EHR system for Obstetrics at Duke. The timing has become a bit entangled in this dialogue but mostly correct. The OB system was developed on the 4K machine with a maximum external storage of 300K. We named tapes by months, and a patient\u2019s record was stored on the month of their due date. Students were hired to man the computer room 24/7 to change the tapes for early or late births. At the same time, we were developing an EHR system for primary care (our department) and the renal dialysis unit. The details of those projects will not be included here, but we locked into a fortunate approach that we called The Medical Record (TMR) that was ahead of its time. AS we expanded into other units, we recognized that we need to develop a generic EHR whose specifics could define through a metadictionary. Over  a period of the next thirty plus years, the scope and functionality of TMR grew tremendously. At one time, we were installed in 14 different groups at Duke Medical Center. A few comments before I leave this area. First, Bill Stead became a true partner and colleague. He was the medical part of TMR, and he made sure I understood the medical content and purpose. He continues to be a personal and professional colleague that is dear to me. But with each clinical unit, I had a medical partner that defined and controlled the medical content and functionality. They are as responsible for the success of TMR as the developers. With Bill and Duke, we created a commercial company called Database and installed the first out-side implementation in a 25-person clinic in downtown Los Angeles. The clinic was called California Primary Physicians with CEO Marshall Berns. From that implementation, two years later, we installed TMR in the Kenneth Norris Cancer Research Center\u2014an inpatient setting. The key individuals we worked with were John Daniels and John Casagrande. We continued to install TMR in various settings around the US and in Canada. Each installation had a major hero and each provides material for learning. All told, we had 44 implementations outside of Duke. For me however, these were just opportunities to learn about requirements in different settings. The last areas I will mention since I have spent over half my career in it are standards. Clem McDonald provided early leadership in starting informatics interest in standards. HL7 became about through Don Simborg and Sam Shultz. I was part of the forming meeting and became the third chair. I also became part of the forming group for ISO TC 215 and the Joint Initiative Council. I think I have influenced the development of standards in healthcare that that are key to where we are going. Some last thoughts. Much of what has happened to me has been watching, learning, and using what others are doing. I firmly believe that nothing is impossible, it just might take time. The world is global, and we need to share and learn from each other. One should always share credit. I am leaving out a lot of people and details. Maybe writing this article will inspire me to fill in the gaps and write that book! Thanks, Kaz. Health Affairs, 2005; 24:1205-1213 ", "Kathryn J. Hannah": "Reminiscences of a Career in Health Informatics As a graduate student, I was working part time on an orthopedic unit at a local hospital when computers appeared on our nursing unit in the mid 1970\u2019s. I observed the response of my nursing colleagues to this event and decided that nursing and computers would be an interesting topic for my graduate work. That paper, K.J. Hannah, PhD, RN, CM, FACMI with encouragement from one of my professors, became my first published paper (Hannah, 1976). Little did I realize at the time that the field of Medical Informatics (later Health Informatics and Nursing Informatics) would become the major emphasis of my graduate studies (resulting in a double major\u2014nursing and computer applications in medicine) and subsequently the focus of my professional career. In 1977, as a nurse with a brand-new master\u2019s degree in nursing and computer applications in medicine, I attended Medinfo \u201977 hosted in Toronto, Canada. There I encountered Canadian pioneers in medical informatics, Dennis Protti and Steve Huesing along with Dr. David Shires who became one of my personal hero, mentor, colleague and friend. It was David, then President of the newly inaugurated IMIA, whom I harangued into persuading the Programme Committee for Medinfo \u201980 in Tokyo that there should be a nursing session!! David returned from a programme committee meeting to advise that there would be a nursing session, but I needed to organize it\u2014always be careful what you wish for!! It was an evening session at the convention hotel assigned to a smallish room with seating for maybe 50 people; as I recall, much to the surprise of the organizers, about 100 people showed up \u2013 standing room only!!! To the best of my knowledge this was the first international gathering of people interested in nursing use of computers. Also, approximately 1977, at a Society for Computer Medicine conference, I was introduced to Dr. Marion Ball who became a lifetime friend, colleague and collaborator. As two of the few women in the field at the time, we began having breakfast together at conferences and meetings. At the time, we were both engaged in providing a lot of lectures and workshops for nurses about computers. At one of those breakfasts, as I remember at SCAMCI meeting about 1982, we were bemoaning the fact that we were both constantly having to photocopy articles as there were no books as resources for use in these seminars and workshops. We suddenly looked at each other and realized that, with Marion\u2019s background in computer science and interest in nursing combined with my nursing and computers in medicine background, together we had the unique combination of knowledge to author such a book!! The result was the publication of our first book and the first book in the field, Using Computers in Nursing (Ball and Hannah, 1984). This original book subsequently became Introduction to Nursing Informatics now in its Fourth edition (Hannah, Kathryn J., Hussey, Pamela, Kennedy, Margaret A., and  Ball, Marion J., 2015). The original Introduction to Nursing Informatics also became the foundation for the Hannah and Ball series published by Springer, Healthcare Informatics. At the time of writing the website for the Health Informatics Series lists more that 90 volumes and provides the most comprehensive collection of books in the field. Books in the series were authored or edited by experts many of whom we personally recruited and are privileged to call friends. In 1976, I accepted appointment to the Faculty of Nursing at the University of Calgary with a mandate to evaluate and develop the Learning Resource Centre. Over the following nine years, Deans Marguerite Schumacher and Dr. Margaret Scott Wright were visionaries who understood and encouraged development of a Learning Resource Centre that included computer assisted learning resources that were ahead of their time as well as the first formal nursing informatics courses in Canada. The decade following my appointment at the University of Calgary saw rapid development of the international community of scholars and professionals interested in the use of computers in nursing. The first international conference \u201cThe Impact of Computers on Nursing\u201d was held in 1982 in London. During Medinfo \u201983 in Amsterdam, the IMIA Nursing Working Group (subsequently, IMIA Nursing Special Interest Group) was established; Maureen Scholes became the first chair of the IMIA Nursing Working Group, with myself as Vice Chair and Elly Pluyter-Wenting as Secretary. The second international conference \u201cNursing Uses of Computers and Information Science\u201d was held in Calgary in 1985; during this event Dr. Marion Ball first used the term \u201cNursing Informatics\u201d. In 1986, I had the remarkable experience of being the first Visiting Nurse Fellow to Australia and New Zealand. The Nurses\u2019 Education Fund of the Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia sponsored the nine-week tour. The tour consisted of speaking and consulting assignments in Adelaide, Perth, Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane, Australia as well as New Plymouth, New Zealand. I believe that it was on this tour that I first met Evelyn Hovenga. Following an initial term in 1978-79 on the Board of Directors of COACH Canada\u2019s Health Informatics Association (previously Canadian Organization for the Advancement of Computers in Health, C.O.A.C.H.), I served a ten-year term on the Board from 1986\u2013 1996 holding the following offices: Vice-president (1988\u20131990), President (1990\u2013 1992)Past-President (1992\u20131994), International Representative to IMIA (1992\u20131996), Chair, Organizing Committee for Medinfo\u201995, April 1993\u2013July 1995. There were two events during that time that stand out in my mind as the most significant. The first was during my Presidency - the convening of the first COACH nursing informatics session and the initial establishment of a Nursing Informatics SIG with COACH. The second was the hosting of Medinfo \u201995. Both of these events were milestone events in Canadian Health Informatics. As the Health Informatics field evolved from an initial attention on hardware to a focus on software then to the emphasis on information, so too, did my professional interest shift to a major interest in information, the necessary terminologies and standards to ensure interoperability. My initial exposure to standardized clinical terminologies came during a sabbatical at the Danish Institute for Health and Nursing Research (DIHNR) in 1991. Randi Mortensen, the Director of the DIHNR was one of the pioneers who, along with June Clark and Norma Lange, worked with the International Council of Nurses (ICN) to develop the International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP). Subsequently, Randi lead several European Union Telenurse projects that produced many of the translations of the ICNP.  Later, I had the privilege of serving a number of national organizations in a variety of roles: \u2022 Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI): Working Group Co-chair, CIHI Partnership, 1998\u20132000; Chair, Programme Committee, INFOcus 2000 Conference, 1999\u20132000; Chair Partnership for Health Informatics Standards, 2001\u20132003 \u2022 Province of Ontario e-Health Alignment Review Board, E-Health Strategy Office, Department of Health and Long Term care, 2005\u20132006 \u2022 Canadian Standards Association (later Canada Health Infoway) on the Technical Committee on Health Informatics Z295, 1999\u20132007, and Chair, Domestic Care 2004\u20132007 \u2022 Canada Health Infoway: Electronic Health Record Standards Steering Committee, 2004\u20132007; Standards Collaborative Strategy Committee, 2007\u2013 2014; Standards Collaborative Coordinating Committee, 2007\u20132014; Nursing Reference Group, 2012\u20132017 My participation in international standards development organizations honed my interest in and contributed to my knowledge of standards and standardized clinical terminologies. Internationally, I have had the privilege of participating in: \u2022 Canadian Standards Association (later devolved to Canada Health Infoway) o Canadian Delegation to International Standards Organization (ISO) Technical Committee 215 on Health Informatics 1999\u2013present \u2022 International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization o Standing Committee on Quality, 2007\u20132012 o Head of Canadian Delegation, 2007\u20132012 I have learned much from colleagues on various committees and working groups at both domestic and international standards organizations. My interest in the standards aspect of Health Informatics, particularly standardized clinical terminologies, persists to the present. Currently, I am Health Informatics Advisor to the Canadian Nursing Association where I am the National Lead for the C-HOBIC Project (Canadian Health Outcomes for Better Information and Care) and involved in the National Nursing Data Standards initiative. My contributions to Health Informatics have been acknowledged by a number of honours and awards. Significant among these was the announcement on July 1, 2015 by Governor General of Canada of my appointment as a Member of the Order of Canada (Canada\u2019s highest civilian award) in recognition of \" efforts to promote the use of information technology to enhance nursing care in Canada and abroad.\" Another outstanding honour was the establishment by colleagues and friends of the Dr. Kathryn J. Hannah Nursing Informatics Scholarship administered by the Canadian Nurses Foundation. Most recently I was honoured by formal election as one of the one hundred founding members of the International Academy of Health Sciences Informatics, IAHSI in recognition of international contributions to health informatics field. The underpinning of my career journey has always been my family. I am well and truly blessed to have the consistent and enthusiastic support of Dr. Richard S. Hannah, my husband and life companion. The joy of our lives through out has been our family: sons, Lieutenant Colonel Richard R. Hannah M.D. and Sean M. Hannah, their respective spouses Deborah and Heather Hannah and our five grandchildren, Richard, Cameron, Kyle, Kinsley and Alexis Hannah. ", "William Hersh": "Professor and Chair of the Department of Medical Informatics & Clinical Epidemiology in the School of Medicine at Oregon Health & Science University. A Passion and a Calling My interest in biomedical and health informatics goes back to my high school days in the northern suburbs of Chicago in the early 1970s. I was introduced to computers when my school acquired a Hewlett-Packard 9830A, which was the size of a suitcase and had a built-in single-line LED W. Hersh, MD, FACMI, FAMIA, FACP display, thermal printer on top, and cassette tape storage unit. I learned how to program it in BASIC. I was also a cross-country and track runner in high school, which led to my interest in health and medicine. Running also taught me self-discipline, which helped me achieve goals later in life. I went off to college at the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana, where I intended to major in computer science (CS). However, I found CS to be very different in college than in high school. My first courses using punch cards and the PL/1 programming language did not excite me. I did, however, enjoy working with PLATO, a networked system with (primitive, by today\u2019s standards) bit-mapped graphics. Two years into college, I left CS to pursue a medical career. My interest in health and preventive medicine, together with youthful rebellion, provided the foundation for my interest in evidence-based medicine. In medical school, also at University of Illinois, I met my first informatics faculty member, Dr. Allan Levy, who nurtured my interests. Of all my education, medical school was the least enjoyable. I did not like the massive amount of rote memorization, which contributed to my later attraction to informatics. In my third year of medical school in 1983, I purchased my first computer, a Commodore 64: I hooked it up to my television as a monitor and to my phone via a 300-baud modem, and connected to Compuserve, which had a medical bulletin board called MedSIG. There I met Col. Gordon Black, who encouraged a number of us early informaticians, including long-time colleague, Rob McClure. The reigniting of my interest in computers continued to grow as I started an internal medicine residency in 1984 at University of Illinois Hospital in Chicago. During my residency, it became apparent to me that I wanted to combine medicine and computers in my career. I came to learn about a field called \u201cinformatics,\u201d but without Google or other search engines, there was no easy way to find more information. This led me to write letters and make phone calls to people like Ted Shortliffe, Bob Greenes, Clem McDonald, Perry Miller, and Scott Blois. I ultimately learned about National Library of Medicine (NLM)\u2013funded informatics fellowships and chose to pursue one in the Harvard program under Bob Greenes at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. In 1987, after having lived my whole life in Illinois, I headed off with my wife to start my informatics fellowship. It was quite a change for me, with my previous daytime focus on medicine and intermittent nights-and-weekends focus on computing now flipped. In the fellowship, I could do computing almost all the time and practice medicine on the allowed one day  per week. During this fellowship, it quickly became clear that informatics would become my life\u2019s calling. Like many working in informatics in the 1980s, I initially tried to find a research interest and niche in artificial intelligence (AI) systems of the day. One early attraction was knowledge representation, and this led to Bob involving me in his work on the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) project that had been launched by the NLM in 1986. But the progress of the first generation of AI was sputtering by then, and almost by accident I came across a report on the topic of information retrieval (IR) authored by Bruce Croft, a computer science professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. There was very little research going on in IR in medical informatics, and the main work emanated from the development of MEDLINE (although Mark Frisse had done some important work during that time in applying IR to the emerging world of hypertext). Croft\u2019s report steered me to the most prolific researcher and author in the IR field, Gerard Salton. Many current senior leaders in IR trained as PhD students under Salton, and I was also profoundly influenced by his work. I had the chance to meet Salton when he came to give a talk at Harvard. He was intrigued by my interest in IR applied in the medical domain. I have always thought it was most unfortunate that Salton never lived to see the wide reach and impact of his ideas and work in modern search engines, as he passed away in 1995. My clinical background dampened my enthusiasm for the relatively clunky and time-consuming AI systems of the 1980s and heightened it for IR. I was intrigued by the idea of physicians and others being able to access knowledge at the point of care. My perception of IR systems at the time was that they were limited, with systems doing just word-based searching on text or requiring complex Boolean queries over human- assigned indexing terms. My interest in IR, combined with the advancing UMLS project, led me to pursue a line of research that combined concept-based automated indexing to enhance retrieval that applied the statistical approaches developed by Salton and others. This led to me to develop and implement a system called SAPHIRE, which was the focus of my early research. During my fellowship, I was also briefly involved with a project that would later become a highly successful commercial product. Bob had been visited by Burton Rose, a nephrologist at Brigham and Women\u2019s who was enamored with a new tool that shipped with the Mac called Hypercard. He believed that small chunks of information on each \u201ccard\u201d in a Hypercard \u201cstack\u201d could be highly useful to physicians. But as the quantity of information grew, he needed a search capability that was better than that which shipped with Hypercard. I programmed the search capability for the first version of what would later be called UpToDate, which ultimately achieved great commercial success. At the end of my fellowship, I handed this project off to another fellow, Joseph Rush, who continued to work on UpToDate for many years. As my fellowship was ending, I knew that I wanted to pursue a career in academic medical informatics. One person I came to know was Bob Beck, who at the time was heading the informatics program at Dartmouth College. By the fall of my last year of fellowship, Bob had moved to Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU) to start a new program there funded by the NLM IAIMS program, bringing with him another faculty member, Kent Spackman. While I had some other job possibilities, my wife and I, now with a one-year-old daughter, packed up and moved to Portland in July 1990. My first activity in the new job was to submit an NIH R29 proposal that I had been working on in the latter months of my fellowship. Also called a FIRST Award, this type of grant was a common pathway  for new researchers to launch their careers. Several months later, I was notified that it would be funded, which jump-started my academic career. In 1990, Oregon voters passed a property tax limitation measure which ultimately led to Bob Beck losing resources and leaving in 1992. This left behind a very junior faculty, led by Kent, but as Kent wasn\u2019t interested in building a program, he devolved the leadership to me. By 1996, our young academic group was starting to achieve sustained success. This led the Dean of the OHSU School of Medicine at the time, Joseph Bloom, to encourage our unit to become more visible on campus. The usual way of doing this at OHSU was establishing a so-called free-standing division, which was the path to establishing a department. This also provided me a seat at the table of clinical department chairs, which I maintain to this day. I was interested in teaching from the beginning of my faculty career, and when Kent asked me to organize the introductory informatics course\u2014something I still teach to this day\u2014it led to many others, like the one I teach in the 10x10 program. When I started my fellowship, and then my faculty position at OHSU, I never realized how much of a passion teaching would become for me. I always enjoyed teaching because it gave me a chance to learn as well as develop a coherent organization for various topics. My path down the road to my current leadership in education was also greatly influenced by those I taught. In particular, while I assumed that our educational program would be small and aim to produce researchers like myself, there were a number of students who were interested in more varied careers, such as the small but growing number of professional positions in healthcare settings or industry. This resulted in our new Master of Science program taking on a more practical orientation. But that was fine, as the research of many of our faculty, such as Paul Gorman and Joan Ash, was motivated by real-world concerns in the application of informatics. Even with my growing interest in education and my leadership responsibilities in our emerging program, I still maintained my interest in research. While it became more difficult to develop new IR systems when giants like Google and PubMed emerged, my interest in evaluating how well people used IR systems for health and medical reasons became the main focus of my research. In 1996, I published the first edition of my book, Information Retrieval: A Health Care Perspective. By 1999, as I was contemplating ways to expand our educational program, a number of people had asked if we planned to offer our courses via distance learning. I decided to offer my now-mature introductory course in this manner, which was quite successful. There was an untapped market for distance learning in informatics, and the success of my initial course led me to convince the faculty to add this format to the program. This foray into distance learning distracted us from another goal we had in the late 1990s, which was to establish a PhD program. We finally accomplished this when our NLM training grant was renewed in 2002. At this point I became PI of the training grant. Another pivotal career event for me came when Charlie Safran was President of AMIA (back in the days when the AMIA President was an elected position). He was convinced that the US needed more professionals, especially physicians and nurses, trained in informatics. Charlie believed the US needed at least one physician and one nurse trained in informatics in each of the nearly 6000 hospitals in the US. Also at this time, AMIA was looking to develop some sort of introductory course in biomedical informatics. However, the prices quoted to them by vendors were beyond their means. As I already had my introductory course from our graduate program, I proposed to AMIA that we repackage my online course. I came up with a name, 10x10 (pronounced \u201cten by ten\u201d), based on Charlie\u2019s one physician and nurse in 5000+ hospitals, and set a goal for  doing so by 2010. Because the course already existed, we were able to put in place a Memorandum of Understanding between OHSU and AMIA and launch the first offering of the course in just a few months. The next President of AMIA, Don Detmer, called 10x10 one of the association\u2019s most successful programs ever. My interest in education and training spurred my interest in workforce development for the field. In 2006, I was invited to organize the surprise retirement event for long- time academic leader, originally from Germany and later from Victoria, Canada, Jochen Moehr. I gave a talk entitled Who are the Informaticians, What We Know and Should Know, which I later published in JAMIA. This interest was fortuitous, since the US economy would soon enter freefall, leading to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), the economic stimulus bill that included the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act. While HITECH was best known for its $30 billion \u201cmeaningful use\u201d program of incentives for EHR adoption, it also included $118 million for workforce development, motivated in part by some research I published showing a need for more informatics professionals. I played a large role in the grants that were competitively awarded by the HITECH Workforce Development Program, including being funded as the National Coordination and Dissemination Center for the health IT curriculum that was funded through the program. During and after HITECH, I continued to provide leadership for informatics education and its relationship to other careers in the field. I was also a leader in the new clinical informatics physician subspecialty, being appointed by AMIA to direct the Clinical Informatics Board Review Course (CIBRC), which was offered in time for the first board examination in 2013. The next year I laid the groundwork at OHSU to establish one of the first four Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)\u2013accredited fellowships for the new subspecialty, which launched in 2015. Around this time, I also had the opportunity to develop informatics education for non- informaticians, namely medical students. Along with colleagues at OHSU, we began to implement informatics education in the MD curriculum (just in time for my younger daughter to become a medical student!). I have now been at OHSU for nearly 30 years, where I have had the opportunity to continue my research and teaching, and lead my department. Another critical activity of mine now is to mentor young faculty, who one day will sustain and lead our program. ", "George Hripcsak": "Professor and Chair of Biomedical Informatics Columbia University, New York, NY, USA Director, Medical Informatics Services New York-Presbyterian Hospital Member: US National Academy of Medicine, FACMI, IAHSI One thing I like about biomedical informatics is that it attracts people from a variety of backgrounds. I spent my childhood remaking old things into new things\u2014 including turning an electric clock into a drive to make a telescope track the stars and turning a Stingray bicycle and a lawn mower engine into a motor bike, sacrificing the brakes to fit the engine. I shifted to electronics because I found that I could implement more complex concepts than G. Hripcsak, MD, MS I could with large physical parts. In college, a friend and I started \u201cEastern European Electronics\u201d repair service for college students, and I built my first computer then, a COSMAC Elf with 256 bytes of memory. Programming was great because you felt unfettered by the cost and time required to assemble physical circuits. By just thinking about something\u2014and then pressing some primitive buttons\u2014you could watch your idea come alive. When I got to Columbia medical school, I worked at an investment bank programming financial analytics to pay tuition; that is where I fell in love with A Programming Language (APL), which I use to this day. During internal medicine residency at Columbia, I wrote a lot of programs, including a parser, but I was unable to test them for years until I got a computer that could run them. Up to that point, informatics and medicine were completely separate for me, but my past fit right in with my future career: using a computer to remake old electronic health record data into new research data. As I sought an internal medicine fellowship, David Margulies, who had just moved from Columbia to become a chief information officer in Boston, suggested that I consider this new field of medical informatics. Then my chair of medicine, Bob Glickman, suggested I meet Paul Clayton, who was in the process of being recruited to Columbia to start the original Columbia Center for Medical Informatics in 1987. I did my third- year residency research elective with Paul and basically never got up from my seat. I had been interested in human consciousness, so my first research area was in neural networks. Paul was inventing a next-generation clinical information system based on his experience with Utah\u2019s HELP system, with Soumitra Sengupta on architecture and network, Bob Sideli (and, later, Bruce Forman) on interoperability via the fledgling HL7, Jim Cimino on an innovative knowledge-based vocabulary, and Stephen Johnson and Carol Friedman on one of the first relational clinical database implementations. I took on automated decision support. At the Arden Homestead conference center, under Paul Clayton, we proposed to unite the two procedural health knowledge languages of the time, Utah\u2019s HELP and Regenstrief\u2019s RMRS system, working closely with Allan Pryor and Clem McDonald. The result became the Arden Syntax, which, with Clem\u2019s help, became an international standard. I had fun because, unbeknownst to anyone, I had used APL as a formal description language to ensure that Arden was consistent; Peter Ludemann verified it for me. Decision support required data, and so I found myself spending most of my time gathering data and defining higher-level concepts based on raw electronic health record  data, which we would now call phenotyping. My first NIH grant, funded in 1994 and then known as a \u201cFIRST\u201d award, was on this topic, \u201cLinking knowledge-based systems to clinical databases.\u201d The best information seemed to be in the clinical notes, and I began a career-long collaboration with Carol Friedman. Carol built the first functional general- purpose natural language processing system, and I focused mainly on the evaluation with later work on temporal natural language processing. We published the first large-scale study of natural language processing in medicine, showing the system was almost indistinguishable from clinicians. This work raised my interest in statistics and led to my pursuing a master\u2019s degree in biostatistics and publishing a series of papers on evaluation in biomedical informatics. Paul left for Utah in 1998, and I served as acting chair until we were joined by Ted Shortliffe as chair in 2000, with Vimla Patel, Sue Bakken, and others also joining. Ted broadened the department especially in computational biology, recruiting people like Andrea Califano and Dennis Vitkup, as well as Gil Kuperman on the health record side and Rita Kukafka on public health. Ted also added informatics to the medical school curriculum, a task later taken over by Herb Chase. I focused on using health record data for public health, very much enjoying working with Farzad Mostashari and also strategizing on national committees with Bill Stead. I continued working on phenotyping and natural language processing, showing how it could be used to detect medical errors, with Genevieve Melton-Meaux\u2019s system achieving 0.9996 specificity, which was sufficient for large-scale screening. PhD trainees like Adam Wilcox, Jen- Hsiang Chuang, Hui Cao, and Li Zhou did a spectacular job, as did the many post-doctoral and masters trainees. On Ted\u2019s move to Arizona in 2007, I became department chair. We focused mostly on data science\u2014as applied in both the clinical and the biological realms\u2014with a reemphasis of electronic health records, hiring wonderful junior faculty like Chunhua Weng, Noemie Elhadad, Raul Rabadan, Andy Kanter, Lena Mamykina, Yufeng Shen, Nick Tatonetti, Karthik Natarajan, and Adler Perotte. With passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, electronic health records became a household word, and my public health work with Farzad led to my becoming co-chair of the Meaningful Use workgroup with dynamo Paul Tang. Dave Albers, an atmospheric physicist, introduced me to dynamical systems with a whole universe of nonlinear time series methods. We were the first to bring electronic health record data studies to the physics literature. We particularly focused on the biases created by health care processes, improving the phenotyping process and continuing work on my \u201cDiscovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases\u201d R01, which has been funded for 18 years. David Madigan and Patrick Ryan introduced me to the OMOP effort, which in 2013 became the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) effort, with the idea of a worldwide open collaborative to do and redo medical research. As the OHDSI coordinating center, Columbia oversaw studies on hundreds of millions of patients from around the world. Ali Gharavi and David Goldstein pulled me into precision medicine, and OHDSI\u2019s data model became the basis of the national precision medicine initiative with Josh Denny. Dave Albers, Lena, and I started using data assimilation to pull together mechanistic models with data science in the setting of glucose metabolism in patients with and without type-2 diabetes. The use of data assimilation with electronic health records and other sparse, irregular data sources was novel. This merger of mechanistic models and empirical data currently appears to be a worthy frontier: using the most advanced empirical methods from data science but constraining the search space with our knowledge. ", "Betsy L. Humphreys": "Deputy Director, U.S. National Library of Medicine (retired) Acting Director, U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2015-16 U.S. Member, General Assembly SNOMED International 2007-17 Member, Board of Directors, AMIA, 1994-6 UMLS Project Director, 1986-2006 In one sense, I entered the field of medical informatics the day I arrived at the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) in January 1973 as a new recipient of a master\u2019s degree in library and information science. Then as now, NLM was a leader in applying computers and information technologies to biomedical information, and in funding informatics research. I was soon involved in online data curation; management of large-scale automation of paper records (via hundreds of boxes of punched cards); development of standard identifiers and data formats; conception of a distributed data creation and maintenance strategy involving what is now known as the National Network of Libraries of Medicine; and oversight of a contract for automated lexical matching of records from multiple databases. During my first decade at NLM, my work centered on automating descriptive records for publications and library holdings\u2014not on biomedical content. I was part of a multidisciplinary team establishing infrastructure (data, standards, algorithms, software, communications) to support more rapid and efficient delivery of biomedical documents. If asked then, I would have said that my field was library and information science and my focus was better access to biomedical information. Broadly defined (to include many types of information and data, e.g., terminology, clinical trials), this has remained a primary focus throughout my career. In the 1970s, a large multidisciplinary group of mentors helped me to understand: (a) the importance of data, e.g., sizing a problem before attacking it; (b) the need for a systems approach, e.g., \u201cdraining the swamp\u201d\u2014even while fending off alligators; and (c) the value of innovation, e.g., implementing a sensible approach even if no one else has tried it. Joseph Leiter, PhD, then NLM Associate Director for Library Operations, taught me to fix prospective data creation first (\u201cThe future is longer than the past\u201d); Marie Pinho provided a crash course in logical database design, database management software, and assessment of scalability and sustainability; Liz Myers, MLS, modeled and encouraged strong relationships across organizational lines and active participation in professional associations. These lessons proved valuable in all my subsequent informatics endeavors. When Donald A. B. Lindberg, MD, became NLM Director in 1984, I was 11 years into my career there and had just become the Deputy Associate Director for Library Operations. Don, a pre-eminent medical informatics pioneer, arrived with the notion that NLM could help computers to \u201cunderstand\u201d medical meaning by developing a yet-to-be clearly defined \u201cUnified Medical Language System\u201d (UMLS) that would support the semantic connections needed to link information (e.g., knowledge, guidelines, patient records) from disparate systems. The vision of Integrated Academic Information Management Systems (IAIMS) had been articulated in the 1982 report of an NLM- funded study by the Association of American Medical Colleges, with Nina Matheson, MLS, as P.I. Don had served on the advisory committee.  Don envisioned the UMLS project as a large, distributed multidisciplinary effort, involving an NLM team and multiple external university-based informatics research groups. I was recommended for the NLM UMLS Team by Lois Ann Colaianni, MLS, then Associate Director for Library Operations. Whether my earlier work qualifies as \u201cmedical informatics\u201d can be debated, but I clearly stepped into the middle of informatics research and development when Don convened the NLM UMLS Team in the waning days of 1984. From that time on, a substantial fraction of my time (on average probably about a third) was devoted to informatics pursuits\u2014at first primarily research and development, later standards and policy. The rest of my time continued to be devoted to management of library operations and other NLM priorities, e.g., planning, outreach, consumer health information, workforce education and development, and government information policy. Participation in the UMLS project, as Executive Secretary of the NLM Team, as NLM project officer for multiple rounds of UMLS R&D contracts, and as one of the designers and implementers of the UMLS Metathesaurus, brought me into close working relationships not only with Don, but also with other established medical informatics luminaries, including multiple early Collen Award winners and many, many rising stars in the field\u2014at NLM and institutions across the U.S. and around the world. In addition to producing the initial versions of the UMLS Knowledge Sources and tools, now heavily used in applications worldwide, the early years of the UMLS project had a significant impact on the subsequent careers of many, provided an influential example of knowledge sharing and reuse, infused new life into biomedical natural language processing, identified key characteristics of well-formed terminologies (e.g., organization by concept, context-free identifiers, multiple hierarchical perspectives, regular and principled maintenance) that became part of the informatics canon, and raised consciousness about clinical terminology standardization issues that the UMLS would not address. The legions of physicians, nurses, computer scientists, engineers, librarians, linguists, anthropologists, etc., who served as my valued informatics colleagues and mentors and greatly influenced my thinking in the 1980s and 1990s are literally too numerous to mention here. They included the investigators and fellows who worked on the UMLS project and other major initiatives: IAIMS, HPCC, and molecular biology data at NLM and many external sites; creators and maintainers of vocabularies, code sets, and classifications incorporated into the UMLS Metathesaurus; testers and users of the UMLS and other NLM resources; members of NLM advisory committees and planning panels; members of the National Academies committees for studies supported and/or commissioned by NLM; and those (from all of these categories and more) who helped me to understand why clinical data were not very standardized and to develop a long term strategy for improving the situation. Don Lindberg is a visionary who is also a proponent of iterative systems development, i.e., a first version based on close study of real data and real use cases followed by subsequent improved versions based on feedback from real users (\u201cSystems that get used get better\u201d). This philosophy governed the development of the UMLS resources and dictated that new versions would be released for community use and feedback at least annually from 1990 on. Close study of the individual vocabularies, classifications, and coding systems that would be integrated into the UMLS Metathesaurus gave me a rare perspective on potential informatics support for health care, health services research, and public health\u2014and on health data policy and standards for electronic health records. By the mid-1990s, all of these had become central to my work as NLM\u2019s first Assistant Director for Health Services Research Information (still  also Deputy Associate Director for Library Operations) overseeing the NLM\u2019s response to a new legislative mandate to establish a National Information Center for Health Services Research and Health Care Technology. The legislation had an interesting genesis in which Morris Collen, the Institute of Medicine\u2019s Council on Health Care Technology, and Alice Hersh (then Executive Director of the Association for Health Services Research) all played a role. Roz Lasker, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health (Policy) in the early 1990s, was influential in integrating me into HHS Departmental data and standards activities and in promoting NLM action to increase the informatics community\u2019s focus on public health challenges. Broad and deep knowledge of terminologies and coding systems equipped me to contribute to successive U.S. government efforts to advance standardization of administrative and clinical data, e.g., HIPAA implementation, Consolidated Health Informatics (CHI) Initiative, Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) initiatives, and HITECH implementation. In my view, the first priorities were (1) to establish a mechanism for selecting U.S. national standards so that use, feedback, and improvement could be focused on them (\u201cSystems that get used get better\u201d) and (2) to provide federal support for robust maintenance and free dissemination of the selected standard clinical terminologies. As it happened, due to the concerted efforts of many between 1996 and 2012, work on selecting the HIPAA administrative code sets helped to justify federal/NLM support for maintenance of LOINC; the LOINC example helped to enlist support for NLM\u2019s US-wide license for SNOMED; the SNOMED license helped to inspire further US-government work on standards (e.g., creation of ONC) and action by other countries to form the SNOMED International Organization (aka IHTSDO); and the existence of a regularly maintained and freely available set of largely complementary clinical terminologies (LOINC, RxNorm, and SNOMED\u2014all substantially supported by NLM) influenced CHI and ONC decisions and the HITECH legislation. I was very fortunate to spend my career at NLM, with wonderful opportunities to learn from visionary leaders and to work on \u201cdream teams\u201d of outstanding colleagues from many disciplines, institutions, and countries. The cumulative impact of our joint work was to greatly expand the amount of electronic biomedical/health information and data available to health professionals, the general public, system developers, and scientists around the world and to take key steps to enable more standardized and useful electronic health data. My hope is that the informatics community will continue to build on these foundations to discover new knowledge and to address the fundamental challenge of delivering actionable information when and where it is needed. ", "Kevin B. Johnson": "B.S., Dickinson College M.D., The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine M.S., Stanford University Epitomizing the \u201cArts and Science\u201d To my friends and family back in 1981, my career aspirations had been clear. I entered college as a bit of a Renaissance man. I was a photographer, a pet-lover, poet, a singer, and a bass player. I was a kid who approached the world with a sense of curiosity and brought that intrinsic desire to understand things into every aspect of my life\u2014 except my decision to be a veterinarian. Indeed, since K.B. Johnson, MD, MS keeping my first pet lizard in elementary school, I had managed to fill our house with gerbils, birds, cats, dogs, tropical fish, saltwater fish, hermit crabs, and every reptile and amphibian I could capture, buy, or trade. In fact, I took a pair of leopard geckos with me to college as a freshman. I began interning with a veterinarian off campus as a sophomore and was on my way. It was chemistry lab that first made me question my career path. While working through balancing chemical equations in the computer lab, I discovered the programming language Basic and then Pascal. As I worked on our minicomputer, there was a gentleman feverishly programming and re-programming software next to me. Peter had been working for weeks\u2014always at the same terminal and always in silence\u2014before I asked him what he was doing. He saved his code and promptly launched a game I had seen people playing on the computer. He was the author and engineer behind the most popular computer pastime on campus. I was not a gamer, but I was enthralled by the idea that I could program the computer and have it do things that weren\u2019t just directly numbers-related. I went on to write the second most popular game on campus, to minor in computer science, and to question why I was so dead set against becoming a physician. What was perhaps most interesting to me was that as a part of my senior independent study work, I researched the opportunities for computers in medicine. I learned about the work of Dr. Randy Miller (QMR), Dr. Warner Slack (history taking), and Dr. Edward Shortliffe (MYCIN). I was intrigued, but too nervous about medical school to give it much thought. I was lucky enough to be accepted at Johns Hopkins for my undergraduate medical education. I worked extremely hard to learn all the science that I had not learned during my earlier undergraduate education. In the end, I did reasonably well by my second semester. Along the way, I made many very close friends, among them a vivacious and equally curious student named Maria. As we were preparing for finals before the end of the first year, she told me that I \u201csimply had to meet\u201d her advisor. She wouldn\u2019t tell my why, except to say that she had a feeling we were going to spend a lot of time together. Following her lead, I made an appointment with the person who would soon become a lifelong friend and mentor to me. Dick Johannes was a lively, interesting, and positive fellow trained in gastroenterology, but known as an expert in \u201ccomputers in medicine.\u201d When I first arrived at his office, almost before we had a chance to introduce ourselves, he walked me over to a computer and had me say into the nearby microphone, \u201cOpen the  pod door, HAL.\u201d Within seconds, the computer responded, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t do that.\u201d This well-known dialog signaled something very special to me. It reminded me of all I had learned as a senior independent study student at Dickinson, but it also re- introduced me to a world I had been missing for almost a year. Dick and I worked together for the rest of my time in medical school. The summer between my first and second year, I learned LISP\u2014a language used in the past for symbolic reasoning. We used LISP-based computers to connect speech recognition technology of the time to a lexicon of terms developed by the American Society of Gastroenterology (through a committee led by Dr. Johannes), and then rules about how to combine these terms into medically acceptable prose. I wrote a report writer in LISP that became the basis for an endoscopy reporting system piloted at Johns Hopkins that eventually became a commercial product. During that first summer, I realized I had found my calling. I loved being able to identify a medical problem, combine my knowledge of medicine and my ability to program, and to turn it into a program that could be used and demonstrated to be of value. During second block of elective time, between my second and third year of school, I worked in cardiac surgery, developing a database and set of reporting tools for post-operative cardiac procedures and echocardiograms. Dick served as my faculty advisor, though I worked closely with the cardiac surgeons and data analysts. This project was incredibly complex, both because of the level of medical knowledge required, and because personal computers of the time were quite limited in memory management and in screen real estate. In the end, my write up of this project won best paper in AAMSI, a precursor to the AMIA Fall Symposium. I spent a summer of my pediatric residency doing research at the National Institutes of Health, focusing on developing computer interfaces that connected external monitors and lab systems to a central database that could be used for research in cardiology. This was a pivotal summer for me. I began to recognize problems in the care of patients, or the conduct of research, that might be amenable to informatics techniques, but my knowledge of the methods, different data types, and prior work in the field was limiting my own ability to develop solutions. Furthermore, I did not know the basics of health services research that would enable me to do evaluation studies of various applied informatics solutions. It was clear I needed additional training, although my project that summer was successful. I made the decision to pursue an additional degree in medical informatics that summer and applied to informatics programs around the country midway through my second year of residency. After completing a pediatric residency, I entered the Stanford medical informatics program under Ted Shortliffe. If I didn\u2019t know before that biomedical informatics was going to be integral to my career, it became abundantly clear during those two years. For my project, I decided to pursue the topic that Dick had introduced to me all those years before\u2014namely, conversing with a computer. As a physician, I had become all too aware of how challenging EHR adoption would be for busy professionals. I also had recalled much of what I read during my undergraduate days and was enthralled by the prospect of a world where we could talk to computers. I saw the problem of data entry by decision makers at the point of care as essential to helping patients who had complex problems. Intuitively, I suppose, I realized that the best way to tackle the problem of connecting speech recognition to standard vocabularies and then to decision support was to work with patients, who were heavily incentivized to tell their story, and who had the time to be patient with computer technology. Ultimately, this project was able to demonstrate that speech recognition technology could be integrated into clinical decision support and could use a conversational model without displaying an explicit set of allowable phrases  in a clinical setting. In addition to earning me a master\u2019s degree, it launched my career in the field as an independent investigator at Hopkins, and ultimately at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. I certainly never expected to be a trailblazer as a part of my career. I pride myself on being true to myself in all settings. Therefore, it was only after I was introduced at Vanderbilt as the first African American member of the medical school faculty to be promoted to Professor with Tenure that I looked back and reflected on my career from that perspective. Along the way, and with tremendous support from colleagues both Black and non-Black, I had become the first African American to win the outstanding senior prize at Dickinson, the first to be accepted to Hopkins from Dickinson, the first to be appointed Chief Resident in Pediatrics at Johns Hopkins, the first (and still only) to be elected into the American College of Medical Informatics, the first (and still only) to be appointed as a Chair of Biomedical Informatics in the country, and a handful of other firsts. For this reason, it is now an important part of my legacy to help in recruiting trainees in medical informatics from a variety of backgrounds who can use their creativity and their unique perspectives to impact this field. Importantly, it has not only been my passion, but it has allowed me to combine many of my skills as a creative educator, as I pursue the dissemination of science to a broader audience. In the past few years, I have produced a documentary focusing on informatics issues, and completed a short video about our implementation of a new EHR at Vanderbilt. My hope is that these products will shed light on complex issues of interoperability, implementation science, and translating informatics principles in clinical settings. Through informatics, I have been able to grow as a scientist, a photographer, a musician, and a teacher! Pediatrics, 2001; 2:E24 ", "Ira J. Kalet (1944 \u2013 2015)": "By Peter Tarczy-Hornoch As was not unusual in the early days of biomedical informatics, Ira Kalet\u2019s path leading to biomedical informatics was not straightforward. He trained in Theoretical Physics, receiving his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1968 at the age of 24, and then embarked on a teaching career working in alternative schools, Hebrew school, and large urban high schools in Philadelphia. In 1978 he joined the Department of Radiation Oncology at the University of Washington (UW), starting in medical physics, where he was able to focus his physics knowledge and abilities towards helping treat human disease, which turned, in short order, into a career in biomedical informatics. He was drawn to medical physics by the ability to apply his physics background to treating human disease. Seeing the critical need for better systems for radiation treatment planning, Ira developed a cutting-edge state-of-the art computerized 3D-system which turned his research towards biomedical informatics. He combined two passions: helping and teaching others with developing software which required complex abstract algorithmic thinking. After his seminal publication of \u201cA Research Oriented Treatment Planning Program System\u201d in 1982, he started collaborating with Cornelius Rosse and Jim Brinkley of UW on the Foundational Model of Anatomy, which had great potential for radiation treatment planning. His first R01 was \u201cA Radiotherapy Expert System Using Simulation\u201d (in 1984) which introduced him to Milt Corn at the NLM. His initial work combined artificial intelligence and computer engineering methods for radiation planning, connecting with pioneers in AI and Medicine including Pete Szolovits, Ted Shortliffe and many others. In 1987 he hosted an Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM) Workshop with AAAI. His experience with practical informatics systems led him to join the UW IAIMS grant (Fuller, PI), focusing on automating the treatment plan initialization and iterative improvement using a generate-and-test approach with \u201cplan repair rules\u201d. In 1998 his focus shifted to automating the delineation of target volumes, i.e., the tumor and surrounding area that requires treatment. He also worked on distributed database techniques for clinical research, cyclotron real-time control systems, radiotherapy treatment planning tools, and simulation- based radiotherapy expert systems. Throughout his career he published close to 100 peer reviewed articles ranging over biomedical informatics, medical physics, and biomedical and computer science. The original UWPLAN radiation therapy planning system (1981-2002), written in Pascal, was designed for the VAX/VMS family of computers, and co-authored by Ira and Jonathan Jacky. It served as the principal clinical radiation therapy planning system for the University of Washington Radiation Oncology Department (UW Cancer Center) from October 1981 to July 1994. The system was a radical innovation in radiation therapy planning system design, was published in both computer science and medical informatics journals, and became the product of a small commercial venture called Oncology Systems, Inc., which lasted from 1984\u20131990. At its peak there were at least 15 other radiation therapy facilities using it (in its commercial form as PLAN-32). The venture  brought modest royalties and equipment donations to the Radiation Oncology Department, until it closed in February 1990. UWPLAN went through two major versions, each representing about 45,000 lines of Pascal code. The UWPLAN system was fully documented by a series of technical reports in addition to the published articles. This was the first radiation therapy planning system to incorporate 3D geometry into the model and the display as well as the first multi-user system. 3D modeling and display are now common in commercial systems, but they have not quite reached the technical level of true multi-user systems yet. Ira was also the principal author of the SLIK software package (1994-2011), which was a user interface toolkit for building Common Lisp applications with graphical user interfaces in the X window system environment. It is listed in the CLiki web site for Common Lisp software resources and used in the Prism radiation therapy planning system. SLIK is available on the Radiation Oncology Department\u2019s web site, including full source code, documentation and examples (the source code totals about 12,500 lines of code, and the SLIK Programmer\u2019s Reference Manual is 90 pages of printed text and illustrations. The Prism radiation therapy planning system (1994-2011) was developed between 1989 and 1994 with support from a research grant from the National Library of Medicine and a research contract from the National Cancer Institute. It became the principal radiation therapy planning system of the UW Cancer Center in July 1994, replacing the UWPLAN system. It is written entirely in Common Lisp, runs on a variety of Unix and Linux workstations, is fully documented, and is available on the UW Radiation Oncology Department\u2019s web site. The source code totals about 82,000 lines of code. It is documented by a User\u2019s Reference Guide (168 pages), a System Implementation Report (approximately 200 pages, currently under revision), a Dose Computation Methods Report (95 pages), and other smaller items of documentation. As an open-source nonprofit project, the Prism treatment planning system continues in use today for educational and research purposes. Ira Kalet was the principal author and project leader of Prism, with substantial contributions were made by Kevin Sullivan, Jonathan Unger, Jonathan Jacky, Robert Giansiracusa, Craig Wilcox, Lee Zeman, Sharon Kromhout- Schiro, Jennifer Sager, Mark Phillips, Paul Cho, Matthew Lease, Christine Sweeney, and Dat Nguyen. Ira\u2019s last R01 grant following his retirement in 2011 was \u201cMeta-modeling methods for biological processes\u201d which attempted to formalize computational approaches to modeling biological processes. It was aimed at using one or more biomedical ontologies or other biomedical knowledge resources as a basis for model structures. One example involved modeling the local/regional spread of tumor cells (metastasis) so that an accurate target for radiation therapy could be defined using the structure of the lymphatic system as defined in the UW Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA) to produce a tumor dissemination model for any specific anatomical site of primary tumor location. Because models are tedious to build manually and prone to errors in transcription of the structures, Ira and his collaborators proposed a case study for developing automated methods for generating dynamic models from biomedical ontologies. The general methods were designed to significantly help researchers to generate new models, ensuring their consistency, and even possibly aiding in identifying inconsistencies in the underlying biomedical ontologies. Ira\u2019s other key contributions to informatics centered on informatics education. Leveraging his own research and contacts, he played a key role with Sherri Fuller in bringing together the informatics community at UW to collaborate on NLM training  grant proposals and establishing formal informatics programs. He spearheaded the effort to obtain funding to establish the University of Washington Biomedical and Health Informatics Graduate Program in 1997 collaborating with Fred Wolf, Sherri Fuller, Peter Tarczy-Hornoch, and Jim Brinkely. He served as Graduate Program Director from 1999- 2004 getting approval for the MS degree in 2000 and the PhD degree in 2003 and led to the hiring of four new faculty members (Wanda Pratt, John Gennari, Jason Doctor, Bryant Karras). He then played a key role in helping UW obtain NLM training grant funding (co-lead along with Sherri Fuller and Peter Tarczy-Hornoch (PI). He brought his critical thinking and desire for rigorous methods to the design of the curriculum, his teaching and to his mentorship as chair, advisor or committee member of 26 biomedical informatics focused MS, PhD and postdoctoral trainees as well as 14 undergraduates (including 3 undergraduate dissertations). He loved teaching and was able to explain complicated ideas in an understandable way. He taught several courses in the graduate program including \u201cComputing Concepts for Medical Informatics (which formed the basis of his seminal book) and \u201cKnowledge Representation and Applications\u201d. He was awarded the Biomedical and Health Informatics Excellence in Teaching Award three times. In 2008 he published a seminal book on foundations and methods in biomedical nd informatics \u201cPrinciples of Biomedical Informatics\u201d (2 Edition, 2013) that emphasized \u201cthe application of formal ideas such as logic, probability, and computational methods for organizing and manipulating large-scale repositories of both data and knowledge\u201d. It illustrates in an elegant way how to write computer programs that can handle data in various forms, perform inference, and use these as a basis for decision support systems in a large variety of applications ranging across information retrieval, discovery of biological networks, drug interactions, radiation therapy planning and computer security. This book is one of the few attempts to develop a comprehensive foundational text for Biomedical Informatics and its development was funded by a resource development grant from NLM. Based on conversations with Ira when he looked back over his career in biomedical informatics, he felt the most important perspective he brought was his formal, theory- based approach to the field (greatly influenced by who Ira was, and by his PhD in Theoretical Physics). Much of this perspective was also derived from even earlier influence and experience with computing during his undergraduate studies. He felt one of the biggest challenges faced by the field in 2015 was that too much attention was being paid to applications and tools and not enough attention being paid to core principles and methods. His monograph on the principles of biomedical informatics was an attempt to begin to create such a foundation (as was his vision for the UW graduate program). Any description of Ira would be incomplete without talking about his rich life outside of UW and his thirteen-year battle with kidney cancer (many times he defied the odds to bounce back from seemingly impossible situations). Though Ira delighted in intense academic discussions nothing brought the same joy to him as his wife (Terry) and their three sons (and two grandchildren). Ira hiked the cascades with his sons, sharing chocolate every few miles to keep them going, coached soccer teams and shared his love of music. Most importantly, he shared his love of Judaism as he blessed his sons every Shabbat. He played ice hockey with passion and truly enjoyed his teammates, attending games just to watch when he wasn't able to play. Prior to that he was a soccer referee and rock climber. Ira lived with intensity and tried not to waste a day. In this informatics domain this was epitomized by the fact that after his cancer diagnosis he agreed to serve on the NLM BLIRC for a 5-year term!  Shortly before he died, Ira wrote \u201cWhat a strange world this world is. Sometimes I get so scared of what we make of it. Other times it seems not to matter at all because the world is infinite and what we do is a transient blip. And sometimes it seems one person can really change the world.\u201d Ira was one of those people who touched many lives and left this world a better place both in terms of his role as a professor and mentor as well as his role as a husband, father and teammate. Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, 1982; 14:85-98 ", "Bonnie Kaplan": "PhD, FACMI Yale Center for Medical Informatics, Yale Bioethics Center Scholar, Yale Information Society Project Faculty Affiliated Fellow, Yale Solomon Center for Health Law & Policy Faculty Affiliate, Yale Center for Biomedical Data Science, Yale University It has always been medicine, and almost always computers, all with an interdisciplinary flavor. I grew up in a doctor\u2019s office. My father was a general practitioner back when there were GPs who had office hours, made house calls, and were sole staff of their offices. We lived upstairs, the office was downstairs. We knew the patients. We saw them in the office and took their phone calls. We helped with record keeping, sterilized syringes, and did paper work for billing. Dinner table discussions included medicine and health care. Medicine has always been part of my life. My bent for both the arts and the sciences made it hard to decide where to focus my studies. I was on the junior high math team, and in the math-science high school honors program, but I took AP courses in English and history as well as math and science. Midwood, my high school in Brooklyn, New York, had a special program with Downstate Medical Center where students could do summer research. My three summers there led to Ford Foundation and Westinghouse Science Talent Search awards. By this time, computers were becoming more common. At Downstate, I learned to program in FORTRAN. Also, on Saturday mornings I took the 90-minute ride on NYC\u2019s subways to participate in a National Science Foundation-sponsored course at City College for high school students to learn MAD programming. So computers, too, have almost always been part of my life. As an undergraduate at Cornell University, I was selected as a student in the first year of the College Scholars Program that allowed us to create our own majors. I proposed putting together Comparative Literature, Mathematics, and Computer Science. There was no computer science undergraduate major yet. Instead, we took graduate courses, and I spent many long nights at the computer center as I learned multiple programming languages while writing both applications and systems software for class assignments. I worked, too, as a computer operator at one of the remote job entry sites for the new third-generation IBM 360 where I also got experience programming the plug boards of the unit record equipment still in use. My summer jobs back home in NYC included working with second generation machines for researchers studying language and speech production at Haskins Laboratories, and writing test programs for a COBOL compiler for a software company. I graduated a semester early and stayed on at Cornell as a PL/I programmer for projects undertaken at the College of Agriculture. Although the comparative literature fell by the wayside, I very much enjoyed my history, government, and English upper-level courses, and decided to continue in that direction while maintaining my connection to the sciences, computing, and math. I became a history of science graduate student at the University of Chicago knowing I wanted to research something about people\u2019s attitudes towards computers. The  summer after my first year, I interned at the Smithsonian doing oral history interviews with John V. Atanasoff, inventor of the first electronic digital computer. My second summer I was hired by the University of Chicago\u2019s Department of Radiation Oncology to write a patient record system in FORTRAN - yes, FORTRAN. We had an arrangement with sister departments at two other Chicago medical centers, one developing treatment planning software and another doing machine control, to share the software. All three had just bought the new PDP 11/45\u2019s. After my coursework, I began working in Medical Physics at Michael Reese Hospital and Medical Center, one of the sister programs. We became a service provider not only for Radiation Therapy, but for other units also wanting their own systems. Still on the PDP 11, I wrote patient record systems in BASIC for Radiation Therapy, for the Pediatric Biochemistry Laboratory, and for Fermilab\u2019s radiation therapy center, and I taught courses for hospital staff wanting to learn about computers and programming. And I discovered the Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care. I went to the second SCAMC and quickly realized that our work should be presented there. That led to two presentations the following year, and more most every year since. Meanwhile, I was gaining experience with real systems in real clinical settings and seeing how clinicians wanted and used them. My experience did not fit with the physician resistance reported elsewhere. Wondering about why people were reacting as they were to computer systems in healthcare led me into a research stream of many years. It became my dissertation topic, and when a graduate student in anthropology (Joseph Maxwell, with whom I\u2019ve subsequently co-authored) commented that I was doing anthropology and I responded that I was doing systems analysis, I realized that the two apparently disparate strands of computing and my graduate work came together. I had found a research area and a great methodological and theoretical approach for future work. My doctoral research on reasons for differential adoption of computer applications in medicine got me into examining change management, adoption of innovation, health care policy, and the ways that what came to be called medical informatics was promoted, the promises it was thought to hold, and the barriers thought to impede it \u2013 a pattern that keeps repeating itself. Knowing what the job market was like in history, I sought faculty positions that would draw on my computer experience and publications, and found one at the University of Cincinnati School of Business with a cross-appointment in Pathology. As I taught Information Systems, I studied the implementation of a new laboratory information system as part of the university\u2019s Integrated Academic Information Management Systems (IAIMS) project that Nancy Lorenzi directed, supported by the National Library of Medicine. A paper from this study became foundational in mixed methods research in information systems, and the experience of producing and presenting it led me to advocate for more methodological pluralism. As a key evaluator on this project, I used the oral history and document analysis skills developed in my graduate work. I also expanded upon them by reading, by doing, and by collaborating across disciplines, in medicine, in business, and in psychology, where I audited a course in evaluation and joined a faculty reading group on cognitive psychology. By this time, I was presenting regularly at SCAMC, and, though growing exponentially, it still was small enough to get to know many others there. For a number of years, various combinations of James Anderson, George Conklin, James Hedlund, Kristen Kjerulff, and a little later Henry Lundsgaarde, Carolyn Aydin, and I were scheduled together in sessions with the few papers with a social science bent. I  began organizing sessions to help bring this kind of work to a wider audience and got to know Bob Brown, Dominic Covvey, Alan Dowling, Charles Friedman, Bob Harbort, Heather Heathfield, and Victor Peel, the few of us doing the kinds of evaluation, system adoption and failure analysis, and change management studies we engaged in. Diana Forsythe joined Henry Lundsgaarde as the only anthropologist examining medical informatics, and Marc Berg, like Jim Anderson, made a place for sociology, so a group for sharing ideas was developing. Eventually, SCAMC was merged into the American Medical Informatics Association. Nancy Lorenzi organized a People and Organizational Issues (POI) Working Group within AMIA, as she did for an Organizational and Social Issues Working Group in the International Medical Informatics Association. I became chair of each of these groups after Nancy. Annette Valenta and Cynthia Gadd, both then new to the field, became POI co-chairs after me. We established the Diana Forsythe Award (DFA) for the best paper at the intersection of social sciences and medical informatics in Diana\u2019s memory. I served on the DFA Committee for its first fifteen years and helped develop the award selection criteria. Jim, Carolyn, and I presented tutorials on evaluation. The WGs planned sessions for the AMIA and Medinfo conferences and later ran a doctoral consortium. The area grew, eventually making a home for the ethnographic and qualitative methods, and what came to be known as sociotechnical analysis, that we early brought to medical informatics. Though randomized controlled trials, modeling, and cognitive analysis still dominate, we continued presenting sociotechnical analysis, ethnography, and evaluation tutorials and advocating for these approaches through our publications and the methods we used for our research. There now is a vibrant community doing these kinds of studies. A similar trend was developing in the field of Information Systems, and through the International Federation for Information Processing Working Group 8.2 (The Interaction of Information Systems and the Organization) I was active in, approaches other than experimental design and modeling were developed and promoted. I co-chaired the twentieth anniversary IFIP 8.2 conference in 2004 and co- edited the subsequent book. The years I spent in Information Systems, then, also taught me methods, theories, and approaches to studying information systems and introduced me to people who were, or were becoming, influential. Through these connections, I was able to learn from and cross-fertilize medical informatics and information systems via conference sessions and publications in each discipline that included people from the other. Meanwhile, when Patricia Flatley Brennan became AMIA President, she appointed me to head a task force on incorporating consumer health informatics into AMIA. Soon after, I organized the CHI track at the AMIA 2000 Spring Congress and, with Patti, co-authored a paper on it for JAMIA. I was elected to ACMI for my contributions to People and Organizational Issues, methods, and evaluation studies, and I was presented the AMIA President\u2019s Award for work on CHI. That brings me to ethical, legal, and social issues. Adoption and change management have a strong ethical component involving how to treat people well in designing and introducing new systems. Ethics, therefore, was an implicit stream in my work. A new project, part of Robert Friedman\u2019s work on automated telephone counseling systems at Boston University, combined my qualitative, ethnographic, and what was starting to be more commonly known as sociotechnical approach to evaluation, POI, and CHI. This project brought ethics into the foreground. Now I was  considering explicitly how CHI applications should be designed and used in ways that took account of ethical issues directly involving patients. Kenneth Goodman was bringing ethical, legal, and social issues as a subject area into AMIA, establishing the ELSI WG, and later, a new section on health information technology in the Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics. His encouragement led to my first explicitly ELSI publication. By this time, I was at Yale University, where I already had started a Technology and Ethics Working Group and ran its monthly speaker program at the growing Yale Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics. That developed my connections with new networks of people as I became a Bioethics Center Scholar and an affiliated faculty fellow at the Information Society Project at the Yale Law School. I founded a monthly faculty discussion group on Science, Technology, and Utopian Visions at Yale\u2019s Whitney Humanities Center, where, for over fifteen years, we have discussed a wide variety of topics from multiple disciplinary perspectives. As chair of POI for the second time and during the ten years when I chaired the IMIA Organizational and Social Issues working group, I incorporated ethical, legal, and social issues into the purview of the IMIA Organizational and Social Issues WG. I developed ties with the new AMIA and IMIA evaluation working groups and the AMIA ELSI WG. Interconnections between these themes were made stronger by my serving simultaneously as chair of both ELSI and POI from 2009-2011. That was when I started organizing joint AMIA WG dinners that also included the Evaluation and Clinical Information Systems WGs, and after a few years, under the guidance of Ross Koppel and Gilad Kuperman, the four WGs became founders of the Implementation Forum. Martha Adams, then chair of the AMIA WG Steering Committee, headed a steering committee that I was part of for this new listserv, leading to several publications and conference sessions. Over the past twenty years, I have been heavily involved with Yale\u2019s Information Society Project as well as with their Bioethics Center, and my exposure to both bioethics and law have further influenced my work. I have integrated the various themes related to people and organizational issues, evaluation, and ethical, legal, and social issues into my research and the many AMIA, IMIA, and IFIP conference sessions I have organized. I saw, and still see, all these areas as highly interrelated, and even more urgent as information technologies, personal health records, and mobile health apps become pervasive. For the past twenty years, then, I have been focusing much more on ELSI and how it brings together the other areas I have worked in. I hope to see the scope of bioethics, of people and organizational research, and of evaluation studies grow to include health informatics ELSI and POI topics, which all can benefit from multi-method interdisciplinary approaches and collaborations. I\u2019ve been fortunate to be part of several fields \u2013 medical informatics, history of science, information systems, bioethics, law and new media \u2013 interdisciplinary all. I must enjoy putting together different disciplines and perspectives, and the ways they can enrich each other. I got into many of these fields as they were first developing, and I\u2019ve seen them follow a trajectory of struggles for legitimacy while, unfortunately to my mind, over the years settling into their own orthodoxies. The intellectual stimulation of being part of it, and of making my own combination of contributions, has been wonderful. So, it has always been medicine, and almost always computers and interdisciplinarity, in my personal development, the paths I\u2019ve followed, and the research and teaching I\u2019ve done and continue to do. I look forward to more.  ", "Lawrence C. Kingsland III": "Assistant Director for Applied Informatics National Library of Medicine (1993-2009) Chief, Computer Science Branch, Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Information, NLM (1987-2009) A Convoluted Journey to Informatics Leads to a Professional Home I came to informatics the long way around. The journey involved a transcontinental US trip in a 1965 L.C. Kingsland III, PhD, Corvair convertible, time as a street singer in Haight- FACMI Ashbury at the height of the Summer of Love in 1967, and an unconventional Thanksgiving dinner. As a young boy, I liked to take things apart. I\u2019d examine how they worked, then put them back together. Usually, there were only a few parts left over and the device still sort-of worked. Then I got more practiced. Often there were no parts left over, and sometimes I had figured out ways to make the thing work better. This was helpful in rebuilding motorcycles. It was also to become useful in an informatics career. Donald A.B. Lindberg, MD had recruited my father, Lawrence C. Kingsland Jr, MD, to create the Computer Fact Bank project within the Missouri Regional Medical Program at the University of Missouri \u2013 Columbia. I stopped to visit on my trip from Massachusetts to San Francisco. At an intellectually wide-ranging and very entertaining dinner in Columbia with my family and Don and Mary Lindberg, Dr. Lindberg spoke of multiple interesting-sounding projects at his Medical Center Computer Program and the Missouri Regional Medical Program. At his suggestion, I took something called a Programmer\u2019s Aptitude Test and was offered a job on the spot. I thanked Dr. Lindberg for the offer and noted that I was on my way to San Francisco. Living in the City by the Bay at that time was exciting and interesting. My street singing brought an income insufficient to sustain life, necessitating an approach to Manpower, Inc. for an actual temporary job paying the $2.00 an hour minimum wage. I unloaded railroad freight cars full of musical potty chairs for a children\u2019s furniture wholesaler. It is astonishing how many such chairs a full-size freight car can hold. What music did they all play? \u201cHow Dry I Am\u201d, of course. Thanksgiving came and went, with my celebratory dinner consisting of a Snickers candy bar. All true. Before much longer, it seemed appropriate to call Missouri and ask whether that job was still available. Receiving the equivalent of \u201cYou bet. Come on back.\u201d, I repacked the Corvair, bid goodbye to my friends, and headed east. In January 1968, I reported to work as a Senior Research Technician in a small six-person group under Navy-trained radio/electronics man Guy Morrison which served as a fabrication and repair shop for unusual projects Dr. Lindberg wanted to explore. Often no equivalent was yet commercially available. As an example, we built an Audio Message Center offering 1200 brief (2-16 minutes) messages on medical topics. The messages were available by normal dial-up telephone to patients, caregivers, and other information seekers 24 hours a day, seven  days a week without operator intervention. We built at least 80 copies of a rack-mounted chassis, containing a small power supply, an 8-track stereo cartridge tape player (bought in bulk for $34); and switches, relays, and counters. The 8-track stereo players were shop-modified to serve 16 tracks monaural, doubling the number of messages each could support and offer to users. We had 1200 messages spread across 12 cabinet racks to distribute the load. The Missouri Regional Automated Electrocardiography System was another project supported by the group. We distributed, maintained, and repaired the portable EKG carts that recorded EKGs on reel-to-reel magnetic tape, then used acoustic couplers to send them over telephone lines to a new computerized system developed in Washington, D.C. by Dr. Cesar Caceres of the Public Health Service, who had won awards for developing the country\u2019s first functional system for computer interpretation of EKGs. By 1971, Dr. Lindberg had formed a new Information Science Group within the University of Missouri School of Medicine at Columbia. In new quarters in another part of the campus, he pulled our small prototyping group in closer to him, a few doors down the hall. His previous computer-based projects had been done with mainframes. Now something called a minicomputer was becoming available. He bought a Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-12, which was a fairly strange beast - a hybrid of a LINC (Laboratory Instrumentation Computer) and a PDP-8, with two complete instruction sets. I had had some exposure to FORTRAN, JCL and punched cards on the campus mainframe. This was completely different. The level of direct control was appealing. I learned to program not in assembler language, but in machine language. It seemed a major step when an assembler became available. We undertook a number of projects over the years, some stemming from Dr. Lindberg\u2019s work in pattern recognition, some from his work in running laboratories and computer systems, some from his open-ended intellectual curiosity, and some from his deep-seated wish to find ways to connect questing people with the information they needed. In 1969, Dr. Lindberg had been asked by NIH to serve on a study section evaluating grant proposals in Computer Research and Biomathematics. Through this, and his later chairing of the National Advisory Committee of SUMEX-AIM at Stanford (1975-1984), he met both subject matter experts and other pioneers in the field that became biomedical and healthcare informatics. One was Dr. Gordon Sharp, an internationally known expert in rheumatology then at Stanford, subsequently recruited to the University of Missouri. A second was Dr. Casimir Kulikowski, a principal at the Rutgers Research Resource on Computers in Biomedicine. Both were to become close collaborators of Dr. Lindberg. The outcome of the collaboration, which began in 1978, was a system called AI/RHEUM: an artificial intelligence program that, when presented with patient findings, could suggest diagnoses in rheumatology and musculoskeletal diseases. Its intended users would be physicians not having specialty training in rheumatology. The three teams involved were Lindberg\u2019s Information Science Group and Sharp\u2019s Division of Immunology and Rheumatology at Missouri, and Kulikowski\u2019s group of computer scientists at the Rutgers Research Resource. Dr. Kulikowski and his colleague Dr. Sholom Weiss had created a software framework called EXPERT that proved critically important in helping acquire and represent the knowledge used in AI/RHEUM and subsequently in many other expert consultation programs. I was the knowledge engineer in training who would investigate how to expand, maintain, and validate the knowledge base of AI/RHEUM with two series totaling 434 cases from the University of Missouri for training, testing, and validation, followed by an independent sample of 59 difficult- to-diagnose cases from Keio University in Japan. Results were excellent, with correct  diagnostic performance in the 90% range. Once the AI/RHEUM project was well underway, Dr. Lindberg in 1980 began a collaboration with Dr. Lamont Gaston, another Missouri colleague, expert in the diagnosis and treatment of blood clotting disorders. The resulting AI/COAG system addressed problems in hemostasis and provided educational opportunities for students, resident physicians, hematology fellows, and other health personnel. I elicited and codified the knowledge from Dr. Gaston and wrote much of the code. The initial version of AI/COAG acquired a clinical hemostasis history and interpreted the results of that history and six laboratory screening tests. The AI/COAG system was unusual in having expanded information on specific aspects of the interpretations in the form of \u201cTell-Me-More\u201d (TMM) and \u201cTell-Me-Reference\u201d (TMR) items pointing to the literature sources underlying the knowledge base. Each TMM or TMR could have other TMM or TMR items embedded within it for further detail. With these and other systems, I was learning the functions of a knowledge engineer. During this period, I had been going to graduate school while working full time, with the blessing and encouragement of Dr. Lindberg. I earned my M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering with a concentration in Bioengineering in 1973, and my doctorate in 1980. The concentration in Bioengineering had four tracks; the one I had chosen could be loosely defined as \u201cbiomedical research using minicomputers\u201d. By 1980, the microcomputer was on the horizon. Huge changes were coming. These changes were geographical as well as professional. Donald Lindberg was asked to become the new Director of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM), part of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. Dr. Lindberg accepted the offer and asked me to come with him and set up an Expert Systems Program in NLM\u2019s original research and development division, the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications (LHNCBC). I said yes. My family and I moved to Maryland in July 1984. My second son was born two months later. The environment at NLM was exhilarating. I was excited by the sheer number of interesting projects going on. The broad-ranging resources, both human and otherwise, were striking and my horizon of possibilities expanded significantly. The Lister Hill Center had an Audiovisual Production Development Branch (APDB) headed by James Main, who thrived on challenges (and sometimes impossible deadlines), so with their collaboration on the audiovisual side, and the real librarians on the searching side, we were able to build a version of AI/RHEUM with Tell-Me-More (text definitions), Show- Me-More (images from a laserdisc), and Search-For-More (MEDLINE search). What a wonderful expansion of information support for our users! The Lister Hill Center used VAX-11/780 computers running Berkeley Unix. Dr. Sholom Weiss and his colleagues ported EXPERT itself (and therefore AI/RHEUM) from the Rutgers Research Resource DECsystem-20 to the Lister Hill Center VAXes. They worked over the ARPANET from their offices at Rutgers, with help from computer systems staff at the Lister Hill Center. The VAX-11/780s served as fine local workhorses as AI/RHEUM development progressed but were still too large and too expensive to serve as delivery vehicles. The relatively new IBM PC and then the PC-XT microcomputer were tantalizing possibilities, but too small. The just-right Goldilocks machine came when the IBM PC AT was announced. Though not easy, it was possible to run EXPERT on an AT with the full 640K of base memory and an additional 512Kbytes of extended memory. We could now work with a mouse pointing device, enhanced color graphics, an external videodisc drive, telephone dial-out to MEDLINE, and a vastly improved user interface. Life was good. The external videodisc drives were fun to work with. With colleagues in the APDB, we produced a Rheumatology Image  Library disc which by 1991 contained 6,830 still-frame images and 23+ minutes of brief motion sequences for use by AI/RHEUM, by the AI/LEARN program being developed by Dr. Joyce Mitchell in Missouri, and for rheumatology teaching purposes. In July 1985 I had the opportunity to serve as Program Chair and conference organizer for a 2-1/2 day Artificial Intelligence in Medicine Workshop at the NLM attended by 160 researchers. This marked the debut of three 15-minute videotape segments on artificial intelligence systems in medicine. This led to my serving as project leader, subject matter expert, and script writer for a Level III interactive videodisc program titled \u201cArtificial Intelligence in Medicine\u201d which became part of a larger exhibition called \u201cRobots and Beyond: the Age of Intelligent Machines\u201d, opening at the Museum of Science in Boston in January 1987. It was then seen by approximately three million visitors during a three-year tour to eight major museums of science across the United States such as the Franklin Institute (Philadelphia), the Fort Worth Museum of Science and Industry, the California Museum of Science and Industry (Los Angeles), and the Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago). In 1987, I was appointed to the position of Chief of the Computer Science Branch in the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications. This brought many new possibilities, more independence as a researcher, and invaluable opportunities to develop as a leader. I could elicit suggestions and ideas, propose projects, direct funding, recruit good people for specific exploratory research, and assign challenging tasks to strengthen the group in chosen areas of focus. It was a superb experience to work closely with very smart, inventive, hard-working professionals and clinical informatics students from across the nation. This period in the 1980s and 1990s brought me into contact with a great many people who became long-time friends, for which I am profoundly grateful. It was a time when many people outside our field didn\u2019t really know or understand what we were doing. Our professional organizations and conferences sometimes felt like professional homes where it was nice for a while to be around other people who \u201cgot it\u201d. I was honored to become a Fellow of the American College of Medical Informatics (ACMI) in 1985. Between 1987 and 1989 I was simultaneously a member of the ACMI Executive Committee, the Board of Directors for the American Association for Medical Systems and Informatics (AAMSI), and the Board of Directors for the Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care, Inc. (SCAMC). Later I served as Secretary and as Treasurer for ACMI; six years as Chairman of the Student Paper Competition for SCAMC; and three years on the Board of Directors of the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) as well as four years chairing its Awards Committee and four years chairing its Bylaws Committee. In 1988, I began serving as Scientific Program Chair for the following year\u2019s SCAMC. With an excellent program committee and staff, we organized a most successful four-day symposium in November 1989 that drew 1,900 attendees to Washington, D.C. Continuing to bring people together to discuss topics of common interest, our NLM team organized and hosted an Invitational Workshop on Evaluation of Knowledge-Based Systems at NLM in December 1995. In February 1998, I volunteered to serve as Symposium co-chair and local arrangements organizer for 76 participants at an International Healthcare Data Card Symposium hosted by NLM. I was a member of the in-house NLM team developing the Unified Medical Language System from the outset of the project, and creator of the first NLM production system that actively used the UMLS Metathesaurus. Before the World Wide Web took hold, we built the Coach Expert Search Refinement System, an adjunct program for users searching  MEDLINE with NLM's original MS-DOS Grateful Med program. The Coach Metathesaurus Browser, working with early versions of the Metathesaurus under MS- DOS, was the second such browser in the world. With the advent of the World Wide Web, some elements of the Coach system contributed to the development of Internet Grateful Med (IGM), our Web-based system for assisted searching in multi-million record databases. IGM was released in 1996 and served millions of users worldwide over its 5-1/2 year lifetime, helping connect information seekers with the materials they sought in 15 of the NLM databases. Along the way, IGM provided users with assisted searching in innovative ways. It made active use of the UMLS Metathesaurus including co-occurrences. It included a direct interface to the Loansome Doc system for document delivery. IGM had a clear, straightforward Boolean interface with search screens optimized for different databases and easy means of specifying limits for the searches. We were pleased to have built one of the pioneering systems in Web-based database delivery and proud of what it accomplished. In the late 1990s, IGM each month was handling 1.6 million searches by users at 180,000 unique Internet addresses in more than 100 countries. The more-capable successor to Internet Grateful Med was the NLM Gateway, a metasearch engine that allowed users to initiate searches in multiple retrieval systems from one interface at one Web address. Released in 2000, it accepted the user\u2019s query and translated it as appropriate for 23 information resources on nine different back- end retrieval systems. The Metathesaurus and extensive mapping functions helped the user find search terms and improve retrieval. In summary, the sorts of research projects I concentrated on in the latter stages of my professional journey included intelligent gateway systems for assisted Internet-based searching in multi-million record databases on multiple backend retrieval systems; high performance multimedia knowledge based systems; expert diagnostic consultant systems and their evaluation; teaching the next generation of capable students; the human-machine interaction; and the presentation of complex systems to the interested lay public. I was privileged to work with Dr. Donald Lindberg for more than 40 years, from 1968 to my retirement in 2009. His contributions to both the research community and the global community of persons his projects served have been manifold and stellar. It was an honor to be a member of his very accomplished team at the National Library of Medicine. ", "Casimir A. Kulikowski": "Board of Governors Professor of Computer Science Rutgers \u2013 The State University of New Jersey Chair, IMIA History Working Group, Past IMIA Vice-President Past co-Editor, IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics Fellow AAAI, AAAS, ACMI, AIMBE, IAHSI, IEEE, IMIA (Hon) Member National Academy of Medicine \u2013 USA From an early age I was enthralled by how people and their machines work. Growing up in the aftermath of World War 2 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, I developed a deep interest in history but also in nature, science, philosophy, and engineering. After moving to the USA, I majored in Electrical Engineering at Yale, where during my senior year I was lucky to take a pattern recognition course with Professor Satosi Watanabe. He was a theoretical physicist and philosopher, student of Louis de Broglie at the Sorbonne and post-doc with Werner Heisenberg in Leipzig. Watanabe\u2019s insights on how entropy relates information theory and pattern recognition were novel and inspired me. Working with him as his research assistant on speech and image recognition problems, I learned about his highly original approach to feature extraction, motivated by atomic logic, which he discussed in his book Knowing and Guessing. When Watanabe moved to the University of Hawaii, he offered me a research assistantship to complete my PhD, and I joined him. This proved to be the first fortuitous step in my journey towards medical informatics. Dr. Robert Nordyke, a thyroidologist and nuclear medicine specialist had recorded clinical and laboratory data from his patients at the Straub Clinic in Honolulu for over 10 years. He had met Watanabe and asked him whether one of his students might be available to help analyze the data from over 10,000 patient records keypunched on IBM cards. This was an incredible opportunity for me to test the subspace pattern recognition methods I was investigating for my dissertation, so was very happy to start \u201ccleaning\u201d the data for Dr. Nordyke in order to correlate results from a highly precise and accurate Achilles Heel Reflex Time (ART) device for screening patients for thyroid dysfunction with the clinical and lab data from his practice. He was inspired by Collen and Garfield\u2019s multiphasic screening methods, and despite a very busy clinical schedule, Nordyke took the time to patiently explain to me what he was trying to achieve. So, I began to model and analyze the statistics of his thyroid data, when, by another lucky stroke, I was introduced to Christine Wilk, a biologist and researcher in animal science at the University. She helped me understand thyroid problems and joined me in collaborating with Dr. Nordyke, while on weekends we enjoyed hiking, mountain-climbing, and swimming together in the beautiful natural environment of Hawaii. We were married within the year, published a paper together with Dr. Nordyke on the thyroid analyses, and shortly afterwards moved to New Jersey, where I started teaching at Rutgers University. Chris and I developed a close friendship with Dr. Nordyke and his family, collaborating for many years after our graduation from the University of Hawaii. We described the evolution of the informatics involved in his practice for over 35 years in an article in JAMIA in 1998. I was most lucky in that both Watanabe and Nordyke were experienced, insightful, and thoughtful teachers, who helped me understand scientific theories, their philosophical underpinnings, and practical clinical problems, respectively.  The next serendipitous step towards medical informatics came from working with Saul Amarel, Chair of Computer Science at Rutgers University, who was a pioneer in Artificial Intelligence (AI) strongly influenced by Herb Simon and Allan Newell, and a friend of Ed Feigenbaum. As I was interviewing for university positions, Amarel was preparing a grant proposal to the NIH\u2019s Division of Research Resources on novel AI methods for biomedical inquiry, which fitted extremely well with my doctoral research, and led to my joining Rutgers. Amarel\u2019s NIH proposal was funded the following year, and I began working with Dr. Lyon Hyams of the medical school on Bayesian approaches to medical decision-making, inspired by the work of Tony Gorry and Octo Barnett. We were trying to explain the \u201cblack-box\u201d empirical results from Bayesian analyses so they would become more understandable and acceptable to physicians. Tragically, Lyon died before we had a chance to develop the ideas sufficiently. However, before he passed away, he introduced me to a good friend of his - Dr. Aran Safir, an ophthalmologist at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine - with whom he had been analyzing data from Safir\u2019s invention \u2013 a pioneering automated refractometer. When Lyon died, I completed the statistical analysis of this Ophthalmetron data, from a study of schoolchildren in New York City, contributing to the testing and validation of the instrument, deployed commercially by Bausch & Lomb. Then, in yet another lucky turn of events, I met Sholom Weiss when he took my graduate pattern recognition course at Rutgers. He decided to work with me and Dr. Safir, and we developed the first AI causal network model as a multi-layered representation of pathophysiological states inferred from data, and linked to their causal hypotheses for prognostic and treatment advice. Safir suggested we use the clinical management of the glaucomas (a major cause of blindness when untreated) as a concrete example to ground our ideas. Sholom had the insight of modeling the disease and treatment processes with a computationally most efficient and explainable directed acyclic graph (DAG) of states representing the pathophysiological mechanisms. We named this representation of expert knowledge a Causal-Associational Network (CASNET). Sholom completed his dissertation in 1974, and we have continued working together in long-standing friendship ever since on problems of expert knowledge representation and machine learning, with a wide range of collaborators, and several generations of doctoral students. With online remote access through the SUMEX-AIM facilities at Stanford, we showed that CASNET could successfully compete with expert diagnosticians at the American Academy of Ophthalmology & Otolaryngology\u2019s meeting in Las Vegas in 1976 and won a prize for our prototype system, having the help of a network of ophthalmologists to support the development and performance-testing of the system. Subsequently we modified CASNET into a highly efficient compiled rule-based framework called EXPERT, which helped us build, together with Dr. Robert Galen of Overlook Hospital and the Cleveland Clinic, the first expert system incorporated within a commercial instrument for clinical laboratory screening \u2013 the scanning protein electrophoresis device of Helena Labs. Around this same time, we worked with Drs. Donald A. B. Lindberg and Gordon Sharp from the University of Missouri-Columbia, together with Lindberg\u2019s doctoral student Larry Kingsland and Weiss\u2019s doctoral student Peter Politakis on representing the diagnostic criteria of the American Rheumatological Association guidelines. The resulting expert diagnostic consultation system AI-Rheum became part of Larry\u2019s PhD dissertation, while Peter developed the knowledge-base refinement system SEEK, for empirically learning how best to generalize and specialize diagnostic rules. Other innovative work was with Dr. Chandler Dawson of UCSF and WHO, where our PhD student John Kastner helped develop the first hand-held computer advisory system for  infectious eye diseases for use in North Africa. Sholom and I described much of this work in the book entitled A Practical Guide to Designing Expert Systems in 1984, which proved a popular best-seller among experts and students alike, as was our subsequent book on Computer Systems that Learn (1991), which was the first book to bridge expert systems with statistical and machine learning methods and their practical cross- validation and evaluation techniques. After working together on many other fields beyond biomedicine, Sholom and I have most recently returned to collaborate on problems of outlier detection in large databases to help in controlling healthcare costs. Starting in 1975 I also helped organize a first series of AI in Medicine Workshops, which, in conjunction with SUMEX-AIM, brought together pioneers in AI in Medicine, resulting in friendships and collaborations which continue to this day. A major objective of AI in Medicine had been to advance the scientific biomedical research that supports medical practice. At Rutgers we collaborated with Drs. David and Lillian Garfinkel of the University of Pennsylvania on AI methods for simulating enzyme kinetics, with our student Von-Wun Soo developing a novel qualitative constraint reasoning system postulating models for experimental design. In the 1980\u2019s I also started a long-term collaboration with Dr. Reuben Mezrich (a pioneer in holographic imaging at RCA before he became a radiologist) on using anatomical graphical models for the interpretation of MRI images, which we later linked to machine learning methods as part of the dissertation of Leiguang Gong, who joined me from Jilin University. We had started an early collaboration with Jilin in 1979 as result of a meeting (during IJCAI that year) with Dr. Wang Xianghao, a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who was an early developer of computer science and AI in China. The collaboration with Jilin continues to this day with exchanges of graduate students focusing on biomedical AI. In the early 1990\u2019s Diane Zimmerman from my lab developed novel methods of constraint reasoning for sequence-specific 3-D protein structure elucidation from multi-modal NMR data with G. Montelione of our Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine. A number of bioinformatics dissertations and projects followed: on machine learning discovery of DNA hydration patterns by Dawn Cohen supervised jointly with Helen Berman; with Ognan Stoyanov, Israel Gelfand, Alexander Kister and Cyrus Chothia on finding a geometric invariant conserved core for immunoglobulin molecule domains; and with Ilya Muchnik and our student Akshay Vashist on a new multi-partite graph method for ortholog extraction for making evolutionary genomic inferences from massive cross-species datasets. Muchnik, an early pattern recognition researcher from the Soviet Union in the 1960\u2019s (whose articles Chris and I had translated back then) joined Rutgers in the 1990\u2019s, and collaborated with me on bioinformatics and machine learning problems, co-directing seven doctoral research dissertations over two decades. At this time I also started working with Dr. Frank Sonnenberg of UMDJ (now R.W. Johnson School of Medicine - Rutgers) on problems of designing and analyzing medical guidelines with machine learning methods with our doctoral student C. Greg Hagerty. Our collaboration continues and has led to investigations into representing and summarizing patient data visually in ways that are perceptually more clinically effective. Reviewing grant proposals to the NIH (especially to the NLM, where I served on, and later chaired, the Biomedical Library Review Committee for two terms) sharpened my sense of how advances in the sciences underlying informatics were lagging behind the technologies, especially regarding difficult issues involving cognitive science and the practice of medicine. Getting to know congenial colleagues at AMIA and IMIA meetings over several decades, I was invited to join Professor Reinhold Haux of the University of Heidelberg in co-editing the IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics in 2001. Reviewing  and editing the wide range of contributions to the Yearbook, taught me about challenging problems across medical, public health, nursing and biological informatics fields, while introducing me to even more colleagues in diverse informatics specialties. Reinhold and I enjoyed working on the reviewing and editorials together and we had wonderful times with our families on both professional and vacation trips. When Reinhold founded UMIT as the first university for medical informatics in the world, I joined him during the summers in teaching bioinformatics courses - with much hiking and mountain climbing in the spectacular Alpine ranges around Innsbruck. When Reinhold founded the Peter Reichertz Institute of Medical Informatics in Braunschweig and Hannover, we continued editing the IMIA Yearbook together until he stepped down, and Antoine Geissb\u00fchler became co-editor with me for a few years. Martina Hutter from Heidelberg was our invaluable editorial assistant throughout, with strong support from Schattauer publisher Dieter Bergemann - also publisher of IMIA\u2019s premier journal, Methods of Information th in Medicine (MIM), for which it was wonderful to celebrate the 50 anniversary in Heidelberg with friends from medical informatics in 2011. Starting in the 2000\u2019s, I began collaborating intensely with Professor Victor Maojo from the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid. Victor is both a physician and a computer scientist specializing like me in AI, as well as an accomplished singer, pianist, and guitar-player, who shares many of my interests in the philosophy of science and how technologies impact biomedicine and society more generally. We have co-authored a number of papers on the relationships between medical and bio-informatics, and the fundamental directions of medical informatics research and AI, while also enjoying a close friendship between our families. The above summarizes how I came to start my work in medical informatics, and briefly sketches some of the major collaborations and subsequent directions of my work in biomedical and health informatics. I look forward to having the opportunity of expanding this story (maybe in future IMIA history books) to describe other close, related collaborations I have been fortunate to enjoy, as well as the diverse strands of insight they have led to. These include ones that produce significant ethical, social and cognitive science challenges when attempting to prioritize and assist patient-practitioner clinical interactions within the business-oriented transactional healthcare information systems which have become ubiquitous over the past two decades.

Politakis. ", "Andre Kushniruk": "Professor and Director, PhD, FACMI, FCAHS, FIAHSI, School of Health Information Science, University of Victoria, Victoria Canada My interest in areas at the intersection of health and information technology go back to my undergraduate days. I received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology in 1981 and a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology in 1983 at Brock University in Ontario, Canada. After completing a master\u2019s degree in Computer Science, I took a position in Toronto in 1986 working on developing AI system systems for the transportation industry at Canadian Pacific Limited. At that time, expert systems were of considerable interest in industry and I delved into questions of how to effectively provide decision support to users of a variety of systems, including healthcare IT. Following my time in industry, I took up working on a major research project at the University of Toronto in Applied Artificial Intelligence and worked with Ontario Hydro Ltd. on developing AI applications for nuclear power using new forms of knowledge representation and user interfaces. This was very intellectually stimulating work in applied artificial intelligence at a time when the AI Laboratory at the University of Toronto was establishing itself as a leading innovation centre in AI worldwide. Developing a keen interest in applying my background in computer science and psychology to health informatics, I met Dr. Vimla Patel at McGill University in 1992, and decided to embark on completing a PhD in Cognitive Psychology with application to health informatics. I was motivated to work in Dr. Patel\u2019s laboratory in cognitive science in healthcare by a desire to better understand how complex decisions are made, and how information technology can support humans. Knowing that Dr. Patel\u2019s lab was world-renowned in the area of medical cognition and education I was keen on applying my prior background and knowledge of computer science and psychology to issues related to human factors in healthcare. I recall my PhD studies from 1992 to 1999 fondly as a time when I made many connections and enjoyed collaborations with key health informatics researchers, many of which continue to this day. My PhD thesis focused on applying a cognitive task analysis approach to understanding how medical students, residents and expert physicians deal with complex cases in the area of diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary embolism. This work provided a conceptual and methodological framework for extension of the approach (involving think aloud protocol analysis) to analyzing end users of health information technology make complex decisions. My first MEDINFO presentation in health informatics was in 1995 and was on applying usability engineering approaches to improving the ease of use of electronic health records and was one of the first publications in this specific area. The early work in this involved video recording, with methods from cognitive psychology, specifically think aloud protocol analysis, to identify and overcome usability problems. This human factors approach has become a recurrent theme of my subsequent work up the present.  When I completed my PhD in cognitive psychology in 1999, there were no health informatics positions available in Canada, so I took up a position at York University in Toronto as Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. My task at York University was to help create and set up a new interdisciplinary program in the area of information technology (the ITEC program) applied to areas such as business and health. During this period, I continued collaborations in health informatics in both Canada and the United States, focusing on human factors in healthcare, many of which began as extensions of projects and collaborations I had established during my PhD studies in the 1990\u2019s at McGill. As problems with the usability of health information systems began to be reported more widely (in particular electronic health records), I was asked to provide help in many new projects, in Canada, the United States and Europe. This lead to my desire to develop new methods for conducting effective usability analyses that did not cost huge amounts of money and that could be conducted on-site at locations around the world, and I began to develop what I refer to as low-cost rapid usability methods. This human factors work showed how usability engineering methods can be applied widely in health informatics. Based on this work we explored the relationship of usability to medical error that lead to one of the first publications on technology-induced error in healthcare. Since then I have worked on developing new approaches to applications of qualitative analysis methods such as protocol and video analysis to support the assessment of user interactions with systems. These methodological approaches have since been adopted by a number of healthcare institutions, including research centers, nationally and internationally. Concentrating exclusively on health informatics, in 2004 I decided to take up a position as Professor and Director of the School of Health Information Science at the University of Victoria, in Victoria, Canada. This was an amazing opportunity to be involved in teaching, research, consulting and administration in one of the most well- known and comprehensive health informatics programs in the world. The School of Health Information Science was established in 1981 by Denis Protti and has since become known for its design of innovative educational programs in health informatics, now offering degrees specifically in health informatics at all levels from bachelor\u2019s degrees to master\u2019s and PhD degrees. I began to become involved, through my administrative capacity, in the promotion of health informatics as a field in Canada and beyond, involving the development of new educational programs and initiatives in health informatics. These included design of a flexible, distance-learning, on-line Master\u2019s program in Health Informatics (the first of its kind in Canada), a double Master\u2019s degree in Health Informatics and Nursing (the first and only degree program in Nursing Informatics in Canada), and the design and implementation of a flexible PhD program in Health Informatics. During this period, I also served on the Board of Directors of COACH (Canada\u2019s Health Informatics Association), and worked on a number of initiatives, including developing academic memberships, health informatics competencies, and a certification process for health informatics specialists in Canada. Given the need for more well-trained health informatics specialists in Canada, one of my main objectives has been to provide education that can help fill the increasing need for well-trained professionals with a balanced view of the field, who can apply the latest methods from the intersection of health sciences, technology and healthcare management to solve the complex health problems of today. During this period, I worked on increasing general knowledge of health informatics and career potential in the field of health informatics at all levels, from new undergraduate students to professionals working in health informatics needing graduate level certification and training. In  recognition of this work, I was elected a Fellow of the American College of Medical Informatics in 2009, which has allowed me to interact regularly with many excellent colleagues and pioneers in health and medical informatics. Over the past ten years, I have extended many of my collaborative activities to projects and research worldwide. Starting with a sabbatical in 2009, I was fortunate enough to visit and spend time in over a dozen countries, including Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Germany, the UK, Japan, Taiwan, Australia and Hong Kong. Based on interactions and connections with colleagues made during this period, the School of Health Information Science in Victoria has continued to become international in its scope, connections and reach. It was important during this period to also recruit top health informatics specialists from around the world, to better connect the School with health informatics practitioners and policy makers in Canada. During this period, a number of exciting projects in the European Union emerged in areas such as development of intelligent methods for assessing safety issues from large-scale data and the mining of such data for new safety guidelines. During this period, I also maintained ties and interaction with Mt. Sinai Medical Center in New York. During this period, I became acutely aware of the need to better understand both successes and failures of health informatics initiatives worldwide, and to disseminate this information to inform new health informatics initiatives. Throughout my career I have found health informatics to be an exciting career through which I have been able to integrate my interests in health and information technology. The problems from a human factors perspective are challenging and complex and I have always been interested in the considering and studying the human aspects of healthcare IT at all levels. I am excited about strengthening collaborations with colleagues around the world in promoting the effective deployment of health information technology, including strong consideration of human information processing when designing systems. ", "Christoph U. Lehmann, MD": "Willis C. Maddrey Distinguished Professor in Clinical Science Associate Dean of Clinical Informatics Director, Clinical Informatics Center University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center IMIA President (2017 \u2013 2019) Reflections on a Career in Applied Clinical Informatics When asked to describe myself, my first thought is always that I am an immigrant to the United States, which instilled me with the need to prove myself more than the next person did and gave the desire to show the world that behind the German accent was someone who was working hard and was competent. While I learned only in 2022, that being embarrassed about my accent was \u201cinternalized xenophobia\u201d, the desire to prove myself has always affected my work ethic and ambition and my willingness to take on new challenges, which resulted in the development and implementation of many new initiatives over my career. My entry into informatics was serendipitous. I was rushing down the stairs from the offices of the Pediatric department at Marshall University in Huntington, WV to my continuity clinic when I was stopped in my tracks by the medical school\u2019s LAN administrator Kent Hayes: \u201cWe should build a patient simulation\u201d was his message. \u201cSure\u201d was my not so serious reply and off to clinic I went. However, Kent was not that easily dissuaded. He knew that I was interested in that \u2018newfangled thing\u2019 \u201cthe World Wide Web\u201d (WWW) and had started to build a collection of pediatric resources called the \u201cPediatric Points of Interests\u201d. For those of you too young to remember these days, the whole WWW was grey, as browsers didn\u2019t handle background colors or images yet. Kent had realized that I was interested in technology and information, and had come up with an ambitious project. He wanted to build a patient simulation designed for medical trainees using natural language queries. Not realizing what I was getting myself into, I proceeded to schedule a month-long elective with him after which we worked for several months to finish the projects. I played the role of the patient, posing for the pictures illustrating the examiner\u2019s questions and the physical exam. For verisimilitude, we added some audio files, and lab examination and imaging results. The tool initially recognized 1,700 questions stored in a simple database, but once users interacted with it, we doubled the number of questions after analyzing the questions that went unanswered most frequently. The user could select from 25 differential diagnoses and 20 treatments. Feedback on the diagnosis and management was immediate. For these early times, the \u201cInteractive Patient\u201d \u2013 as we called it \u2013 was a huge success. We released it in June 1995 and at its peak it had two thousand unique visitors per hour, and provided Continuing Medical Education credits at Marshall University\u2019s website long after I had moved on to Johns Hopkins University. That year, I went to my first AMIA Annual Symposium where several times in the hallway, conference participants recognized me: \u201cYou are the Interactive Patient\u201d. This experience made me realize two things: first, that the new medium of the WWW had enormous potential for mass distribution of educational (or any) content, and second, informatics with its tools like databases and natural language processing was going to revolutionize healthcare. When I was given the opportunity to apply for an individual fellowship grant from the National  Library of Medicine (NLM) to learn Clinical Informatics under the leadership of Harold P. Lehmann, MD, PhD (no relations but the source of many jokes over the years) at Johns Hopkins, I did not hesitate. We improved the patient simulation, though its novelty gradually wore off. Nevertheless, the training led to my becoming Director of Clinical Information Technology for the Johns Hopkins University Children\u2019s Center. In this role, I focused on quality and safety of care delivery and how it could be improved with health informatics. Two major professional responsibilities have guided my subsequent career in Informatics. As a practicing neonatologist, I was deeply interested in tools and systems used in clinical care and I focused on the applied aspects of Informatics. Because of my involvement in Pediatrics, I sought to improve systems to provide better care to children first at Johns Hopkins, then Vanderbilt, and now at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, where I direct the Clinical Informatics Center and serve as Associate Dean. With the help of Prof. Reinhold Haux and Dr. Marion Ball, I launched the journal Applied Clinical Informatics in 2009, which by 2021 received over 300 submissions annually and had been indexed in Medline for over a decade. I have remained Editor-in-Chief since its inception. This journal was an important step towards Clinical Informatics developing into its own subspecialty for physicians in the US. Subsequently, I was greatly honored to become the first board certified chair for the new Subspecialty of Clinical Informatics. Starting two Clinical Informatics fellowships (Vanderbilt and University of Texas Southwestern) in addition to a Master of Science in Health Informatics) I remain deeply involved in the matters of ACGME accreditation and fellowship training and funding. As a pediatrician, I took great interest in the development of electronic health records (EHR). As the Medical Director of the Child Health Informatics Center at the American Academy of Pediatrics, I researched and lobbied on behalf of children for more than 10 years to improve pediatric functionality. One of our proudest achievements was the inclusion of the pediatric EHR certification in the 21st Century Cures Act. I have had the great honor to serve on the board of the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA), and as President of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA). In this last position, I was able to develop and launch the International Academy of Health Informatics (IAHSI), which had its first meeting in Gothenburg, Sweden in 2018. Election as Fellow of the Academy and the American College of Medical Informatics have been among the highest professional honors. In summary, my entry into informatics was serendipitous and not planned, but focusing on the interface of informatics with my clinical profession has allowed me to drive development and make care safer and more effective. It has been a wonderful experience. I believe that I have had a more of a lasting effect on patients in my role as an informatician than as a physician. What has made my career most rewarding were the many mentees and students I have worked with over the years. Their intellectual curiosity has challenged and enriched my life. I am grateful for their trust in me over the years. However, none of this would have been possible without the love and support of my wife, who has been my toughest critic and biggest fan over the years. ", "Donald A. B. Lindberg (1933 \u2013 2019)": "Beginnings: Computing and Divided Loyalties In 1960, I found my loyalties divided and challenged. It bothered me seriously. I had come to the University of Missouri in Columbia from the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City to work in the Department of Pathology \u2013 and to try out life in a \u201cnew\u201d Medical School. My salary was divided between the NIH research grant I brought with me and the practice budget of the Path Department. All swell. My wife and I loved the Midwest and its people. There was plenty of useful and interesting work to be done, much derived from benign neglect by the dying Chairman. I felt honor-bound to push forward the NIH research but also duty-bound to run my share of the very busy clinical laboratories. And, when time allowed, of course, to lecture to medical students and clinical pathology techs and keep up with surgical frozen sections and autopsies. I also ran the Blood Bank (uneasily) and helped with the new open-heart surgery program. A happy life with a view of a pasture full of University Black Angus cattle, and our Walking Horses instead of the cruiser on the Hudson River. The problem arose for me (for a common problem, the limit on hours in the day). In the clinical microbiology lab (my first love), the senior tech had degrees, experience, and personal integrity to spare. She, lucky gal, also had me supervising the show. We had many partly trained techs and students. One result that haunted me was our overall inability to spell bacterial names with much consistency or precision. Ditto one worried about the innumerable handwritten reports of the presence or absence of bacterial sensitivity to a long list of antibiotics. Of course, the commonest question put to me by clinicians was, what antibiotic should the patent receive? I soon learned that the then- common disk diffusion/ growth inhibition method for imputing sensitivity left much to be desired. Hence, I began experiments to make such tests in liquid growth media. This work critically involved a brilliant sophomore physics student from the University. We spent a few hours drinking in front of a lovely log fire one night and concluded he and I could, in a couple of months, build a suitable machine for testing this new method. Building the machine in truth took two years, but ultimately it yielded a fine measure of bacterial growth in broth and serial dilutions of a dozen antibiotics over a period of 24 hours. This in turn allowed selection of antibiotic drug therapies that cured a number of life threatened patients. There was one big problem: analyzing a one-day run took over two days using our crude manual recording systems. We soon discovered a Burroughs 5000 computer in the University\u2019s math department. It was informed via paper tape but it could at least run Fortran. The language was Greek to me. I learned Cobol since it looked easier, but I soon agreed that the physicist tyro was a better chooser of programming languages for plotting data. We were granted our very own 15 minutes on  the Burroughs, albeit beginning at midnight each night. Later the University added an IBM 1620. And it could read punch cards! Hurray! So\u2026a computer made half of my life much easier. This made me wonder if computers might be a way to upgrade the clinical labs that constituted my other duty. This turned out to be true, but another multi-year project. First, there was no computer- based hospital laboratory system in the world, because no one had built one. The med school dean, Dr. Vernon Wilson (and I) negotiated a 60% discount for the University hospital so we could have our own computer (an IBM 1410). I had gotten drawn into helping with some general, simple-minded hospital systems (e.g. admissions, billing, recording coded diagnoses). Clearly, we should add the soon- to-come clinical lab system. My first version of the lab system included the microbiology lab plus clinical chemistry, and hematology. It was based on pre-punched cards that were assembled into a message that constituted the report of the result of a single lab test. The cards drove a concocted telephone transmission system that printed reports in the various ward stations throughout the hospital. The printers we installed in the pre-existing telephone rooms. An unexpected dollar saving came when we eliminated use of the three- part pressure sensitive lab ordering forms (@ 5.5 cents a piece) for our new computer ordering forms (@ 0.1 cents a piece). I note with regret that we had not yet imagined the troubles that on-line doctors\u2019 orders could bring us. I also note that my old medical school friend Dr. Warner Slack working at the University of Wisconsin in psychiatry had also been inspired by the concept of a roost of pre-punched cards, in his case to make up a computer-based patient history system. My second lab transmission system got support from another NIH research grant. It replaced the punch cards with a new (and unannounced) densely coded matrix keyboard that IBM had developed for use in the Manhattan garment district to be help in entering orders (sizes, cuts, colors, finish, etc.) for production of clothing items. A fun machine. Soon we figured out that computer control of the lab data gave us the ability to begin testing error detection and lab quality control schemes. This added a bit of science to our discussions with visitors. Pattern recognition and diagnosis were the next areas for focus. The Missouri lab system quickly became widely known as the first. In its third year of operation we were visited by groups from 45 medical centers. We had to limit the visitors to Thursdays only with a mandatory 3-hour lecture-tour before I met the groups after lunch. It was an exciting time. IBM was of course delighted. I agreed once to their including me and the system in a 35 mm colored film of this and a few other kinds of early medical computer applications. I agreed if they included the Dean and his airplane. My lab section of the film was planned for only 3 minutes. I figured to skip lunch that day in order to facilitate the filming. When the day dawned, two full size IMB trailer trucks pulled into our parking lot, and the film director told me that standard planning for 35 mm color filming was one day per minute. Subsequently I came to understand that filming also included recording speech and the ambient distracting noises of a lab. For us the condenser blowers, air-conditioning and things dropping down the hall added unwanted realism and countless delays. Viewing this old film brings back lots of welcome memories along with my deep sympathy and empathy for our current young investigators and their technical and conceptual troubles in getting their research started. ", "Nancy M. Lorenzi": "Professor, Biomedical Informatics Vice President for Strategic Change Management Vanderbilt University Medical Center IMIA President (2004 \u2013 2007) Journey to Today Getting to my role in medical informatics was a \u201clong and winding road,\u201d to quote Paul McCartney of the Beatles. When I was a very young child, I spent time organizing and re-organizing a collection of books that my parents had on multiple bookshelves. Moving forward to my college days, I was also working in a hospital radiology department and took it upon myself to organize a mini library. From there I went on to become the person responsible for a hospital library. At that critical moment, the National Library of Medicine offered a program at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio to train medical librarians. I was honored to be one of 6 people selected nationally to be part of this educational program. At Case Western University, one of the elective tracks involved documentation and information systems. I signed up for courses in that track and still remember the core concepts learned in those courses. In accepting my first position after my master\u2019s degree, I went to an organization that was using early technologies to manage its book collection. From my first position to becoming the director of a major university medical library system the use of technology to improve process and services was critical. When the university was moving to more technological solutions, I made a case for and became one of the first if not the first part of the organization to participate in the new technological changes. At the same time, I continued my education for a second master\u2019s degree and a PhD degree. I became more interested in both the technology and the people-process side of the equation. I submitted and became the Principle Investigator on one of the early IAIMS (Integrated Academic (now Advanced) Information Management Systems) grants for planning. With this role the medical center created the Medical Center Information and Communications (MCIC) organization that included academic computing, all medical center libraries, the graphics/video communication and the news bureau. This organization began to show the interconnection of informatics with multiple components of an academic medical center. Our progress started with my pain. As the principle investigator of the IAIMS grant I experienced many obstacles. One obstacle was a hospital administrator who very clearly told me that \u201cthe doctors did not need computers, but he needed the money, so that is where I needed to focus my effort.\u201d Two very interesting and connected events occurred. First, Dr. Marion Ball suggested that I write about what I had experienced. This suggestion turned into the book, Organizational Aspects of Health Informatics: Managing Technological Change, that I had the honor with write with my husband, Robert Riley and was published in 1994. Second, while writing about the non-technical side of informatics I thought a working group in AMIA would be a good idea. When I approach AMIA I was advised by several key AMIA people at the time to focus on teaching medical students about  informatics. While of interest, this was not my main focus and I approached the IMIA leadership. It will soon be 25 years that I started the People and Organizational Issues working group in the International Medical Informatics Association. The IMIA working group is now renamed to Organizational and Social Issues. After the working group was started in IMIA, I worked to bring it to AMIA. Both the IMIA and the AMIA working groups continue to this day and have had a series of very interested leaders. As a total concept there is a greater interest today in how the non-technical components of informatics affect informatics efforts and implementations that there was in 1992-1993 when this more concerted effort started. Strategic Planning and my IMIA Presidency: My direct involvement with the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) started in 1986 with Medinfo Congress in Washington, DC. I was impressed with the energy and excitement from the participants and the coming together of the international community. I became more active in IMIA over time starting with creating the People and Organizational Issues Work Group during the 1992-1993 time period. The working group is now renamed Organizational and Social Issues. In 1998, I was elected to be the IMIA Vice President of Working Groups. In 2002, I was honored to be elected as the President-elect of IMIA with a term of 2004-2007 (or from the San Francisco Medinfo to the Brisbane Medinfo). In 2005, we started to build a strategic plan for IMIA titled, \u201cTowards IMIA 2015!\u201d The planning team consisted of 8 members assemble from across the world. The team assembled guiding principles for IMIA. Two early examples included: IMIA will have an international reputation for excellence, impartiality, integrity, and scientific rigor. Also, IMIA will foster collaboration and build bridges to other bodies worldwide. The outcome of the 2005-2007 planning effort produced the IMIA mission or purposes. IMIA will provide leadership and expertise to the multidisciplinary health focused community and policy makers to enable the transformation of healthcare in accord with the world-wide vision to improve the health of the world population. IMIA will fulfill its vision by: \u2022 Being the scientific informatics association through which the world\u2019s knowledge leaders come together to effectively and efficiently create, assemble, integrate, synthesize or assimilate intellectual knowledge that is required worldwide to advance biomedical informatics in its role of improving health and healthcare. \u2022 Being the informatics association that effectively and efficiently connects people and the nations of the world to be able to accomplish the above purpose. \u2022 A major difference of this planning effort was having five concentric circles that represented its multiple dimensions. (Figure 1) \u2022 The core dimension of IMIA is knowledge, from which all other circles as well as IMIA\u2019s strategies, interactions and efforts emanate. Knowledge means the concepts, methods, education, and research that underpin health and biomedical informatics directly and indirectly. \u2022 The second circle represents the science layer, where IMIA members have their connection and integration with the science and discovery of informatics.  \u2022 The third circle represents the application layer of the scientific discoveries. Within this circle are the informatics applications that address the multiple practical applications of informatics tools. \u2022 The fourth circle represents IMIA\u2019s impact layer. This refers to the potential impact that IMIA can have on governments, nations, outcomes, health professionals, individuals and others. \u2022 The fifth (or outer) circle represents the people layer. Items in this circle include individuals, citizen organizations, personal health involvement, dissemination and acceptance, enabling personal responsibility, and public/personal health. Figure 1: The Five Concentric Figure 2: The Six Sectors of the IMIA Circles of the IMIA The Six \u201cPie\u201d Sectors: Superimposed on the five concentric circle layers are six major subject-focused sectors. Knowledge is also the core of each of the six sectors (Figure 2). \u2022 The sectors start at the top of the circle with the health sector. The components within the health sector represent the IMIA vision. \u2022 The next sector is research (how we understand and create to support health). \u2022 This is followed by the behavioral responsibility (ethics) sector (our ethical and social responsibility). \u2022 The next sector is education (best practices) (educating ourselves and others). \u2022 The next sector represents the multiple types of relationships (our responsibility to build relationships among stakeholders). \u2022 The final sector is the connectivity of IMIA (our obligation to share, distribute and disseminate). This significant effort set the stage for IMIA to implement programs and efforts that would support an integrated systematic effort. The IMIA General Assembly meeting in Brisbane, Australia strongly endorsed the planning effort and the goals for moving forward. ", "Alvaro Margolis": "Past IMIA Vice-President for MEDINFOs Associate Editor of Applied Clinical Informatics Director of EviMed President of the Global Alliance for Medical Education In 1990, I was a Resident in Internal Medicine at the University Hospital in Montevideo, Uruguay. My work life was at the hospital, seeing patients all day long, and enjoying clinical practice. My parents had just given me a personal computer as a present for my birthday. \u201cWhat use could it have A. Margolis, MD, MSc, FIAHSI for me?!\u201d I thought. Around that time, I read a paper about a British computer-assisted anticoagulation clinic, and challenged myself to think about a solution inspired by that article, that could help manage these patients, who so frequently departed from their therapeutic goals, with complications arising from both under- and overtreatment. The idea was to develop a comprehensive computer program that would give recommendations based on clinical practice guidelines, while also providing specific patient instructions at each visit, to help empower the patient. Furthermore, it should be a tool to audit laboratory results, and help implement the INR as the standard representation of prothrombin time, not widely used at that time. With this in mind, I started programming, but quickly realized that I needed a professional team to develop the software, rather than just doing it in my own amateur way! Recruiting a professional team, we produced and implemented a system at the University Hospital by the time I became a young member of the Faculty of the Department of Internal Medicine. The system helped follow 200 patients there, to be joined later by several other institutions in Uruguay and Argentina (Margolis, 1994). While I was busy with systems development and working more than full time as a young physician, with two small children, I came across an article in JAMA by Ted Shortliffe and Bob Greenes, describing Medical Informatics as an emerging academic discipline, and I decided to go the USA to learn about it and specialize in it myself. So I wrote to both the authors and received responses with a list of academic centers teaching Medical Informatics in the USA. Then I wrote to many of these centers, by fax. (I had to go to the phone company to send and receive faxes to the USA; we had no email or Web access at the time.) I was particularly intrigued by the University of Utah program. While on vacation in Miami with my family, I called the University of Utah, and arranged to visit it for one day. Gil Kuperman was a student there; he welcomed me and walked me through the LDS Hospital and University facilities of the program, where I met Allan Pryor (who had lived in Uruguay for two years) and Homer Warner, and I received a book about the HELP system that impressed me a lot. So, the seeds were planted for my stay in Salt Lake City for two years, where I obtained a Master\u2019s Degree in Medical Informatics in 1995 while I was on paid leave from my University position in Uruguay and serving as a research assistant at the University of Utah. Homer Warner, Reed Gardner, and Bruce Bray were my thesis committee, which was an incredible opportunity to learn from them. Roberto and Beatriz Rocha became our friends and helped very much (Margolis, 1995 and thesis).  It was a tough decision to go back home, because there were no clear career paths for somebody trained like me. However, we did go back to Uruguay, which was another risky decision. As I continued as an Associate Professor of Internal Medicine, I started working as a consultant for the Social Security, where a large implementation of a health information system was carried out, inspired in some of the concepts learned in Utah. Some of these experiences were published (Margolis, 1999); it was a complex project, and over the years, it proved very successful. By that time, I continued with a part-time teaching position in Internal Medicine, where I also had the chance to get involved with distance education at the University. In 1996, the Uruguayan Society of Health Informatics was founded, and I became its first President. At the same time, international academic links with Argentina, Brazil and Mexico were established, and the first efforts in education on health informatics topics were carried out in Uruguay. Furthermore, initial regulations were developed during those years, providing a framework for the current comprehensive National Initiatives during the last 10 years. Many of these efforts were helped by our regional leaders, particularly Fern\u00e1n Quir\u00f3s, Daniel Luna and their team at Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, and also with Beatriz Leao, Renato Sabbatini, and other colleagues from Brazil. In the year 2000, I was invited to join the School for Postgraduate Studies, at the School of Medicine, University of the Republic in Uruguay, to help implement a comprehensive national program for continuing professional development for Uruguayan physicians. I stayed there for 8 years and learnt a lot about continuing professional development (Margolis, 2007). I also had the chance to participate\u2014between 2007 and 2009\u2014in the design and initial steps of a national program on health information systems across a federation of over 20 health care institutions in different parts of Uruguay (Margolis, 2010). Along the way, IMIA-LAC continued evolving, and I was given the opportunity to become its President, while also becoming involved in IMIA educational developments (see Hersh, 2010). Later, as IMIA Vicepresident for Medinfos, we organized Medinfo 2015 in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, with a multicultural, multilingual perspective. Over the past 5 years, I have been involved in developing an academic group at the University of the Republic (Uruguay), School of Engineering, to develop an academic offering in biomedical informatics for the country. In 2003, in the middle of a severe economic crisis in Uruguay and the region which prevented me from continuing doing consulting work\u2014since there were no positions available anymore\u2014I considered options\u2014including migrating, which was not possible because of family reasons\u2014and decided with friends to create a company, EviMed, addressing the integration of clinical information systems and physician learning. We later specialized in international multi-lingual continuing education for physicians across Latin America (Margolis 2013 and Medina 2017). Part of the work has been quite innovative; for example, by introducing social network analysis to recreate a meaningful learning environment and discussions with respected colleagues applying the way Facebook does it; and still allowing for a large numbers of participants (frequently between 1000 and 1500), with a small number of tutors, similar to other massive open online courses (MOOCs) (Margolis, 2015). So, this has been a challenging but very rewarding journey, where I have had the chance to merge several disciplines into my daily life, with the help of very good interdisciplinary teams, and colleagues from around the world. ", "Heimar de Fatima Marin": "Alumni Professor, Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo-Brazil Editor - International Journal of Medical Informatics Past Chair, IMIA NI SIG Scientific Coordinator, ICT Health in Brazil, CETIC-NIC.BR. I began my undergraduate nursing education in 1980, at the Escola Paulista de Medicina. From the first my intention was to specialize in maternal care, which attracted me because it involves the incredible event of giving birth. As a student, I studied intensely, and dedicated myself with focused interest, which must have been very obvious, since while studying Health Services Administration in my third H. de Fatima Marin, RN, undergraduate year, while working at a Maternity Hospital in MS, PhD, FACMI, FIAHSI S\u00e3o Paulo, I was asked by the head of the obstetrics clinic, Dr. Jos\u00e9 J\u00falio de Azevedo Tedesco, whether I would like to perform a delivery. Naturally I accepted, and in this way was \u201cinitiated\u201d in my future career as an obstetrician. At the end of my undergraduate years, I completed a specialization certificate in obstetrics and was invited to be a scholar in the Obstetric Nursing Course of the Escola Paulista de Medicina. As a student I lived with colleagues who had recently been my teachers, which proved very important by showing me that beyond scientific knowledge, familiarity and knowledge of people is essential in order to get to know the differences along the full spectrum of healthcare problems. After some years, I started a master\u2019s course and applied for a position as an assistant teacher. While working on my master\u2019s degree Dr. Tedesco, again came to mentor me, though in a different way\u2014helping me conduct a study as one of the experts building a knowledge base for a decision support system. It was around this time that my interest in computers was awakened. I decided that my master\u2019s study would be in this area and went to the Paulista School of Medicine to search for an advisor, since there were no teachers working in this field in the Nursing Department. I learned about a new Health Informatics Center and scheduled an appointment with its coordinator\u2014Dr. Daniel Sigulem. I remember the day perfectly: shortly after hearing my goals for the course of study, Dr. Sigulem agreed to become my advisor. In this way I was able to begin my research in this new field. A doctoral program was a natural continuation and I decided to focus on computer science aspects, guided by Dr. Sigulem, since the objective of my doctorate was to extend what I had already started with the master\u2019s degree. While my research became increasingly focused on computer science, I continued working daily, both in the delivery room and the prenatal outpatient clinic, supervising students and internship placements. In the Department of Nursing, I was able to establish the Nucleus of Informatics in Nursing (NIEn), with the support of Drs. Sigulem, Profesor Rosa A. Pimenta de Castro and other colleagues in obstetrics nursing and related disciplines. It was a great challenge, but very stimulating since it involved many hours teaching the introduction of informatics to faculty colleagues, secretaries and students. NIEn was growing, and I organized several events, and with teachers and nurses of the Hospital in S\u00e3o Paulo began research projects and collaborated intensely in the classes that we took in practically almost all the courses of specialization offered by the department at the time. As I was completing my doctorate it occurred to me that I could further expand my  academic horizons by pursuing an international postdoctoral program! My academic life has obviously been a reflection of who I am: I need challenges, I crave goals and I pursue them responsibly, guided by curiosity and genuine interest. I began to look into places where I could find a postdoctoral degree program, and I ended up deciding on the University of Maryland Nursing School, which was the pioneering school in the United States providing doctoral degrees in computer science in nursing. I thought it would be an interesting and productive experience; which could help me establish a similar course at my University where, by this time I was already an Assistant Professor. It was then that I met Dr. Charles Safran during the Congress that the Brazilian Society of Health Informatics (SBIS) organized in Porto Alegre. After the SBIS congress Dr. Safran came to S\u00e3o Paulo and had the opportunity to find out a little about my work in Nursing Informatics. Shortly after I received an invitation to take a postdoctoral course under his direction at the Center for Clinical Computing at Harvard Medical School. I decided to pursue this unique opportunity and it proved to be an excellent choice not only professionally, but personally. Having had the chance to work with Dr. Safran was greatly inspiring, and an experience that I have been most fortunate to enjoy. His insightful professionalism and knowledge, and deep humanity, offered me an incomparable and invaluable learning experience. Since then, we have continued to work together on many fronts, from publishing international journals and organizing events to continuing partnerships in healthcare informatics projects and research. The time I lived in the United States introduced me to many good friends and colleagues. And I was also able to connect with many Brazilian researchers active internationally, such as Dr. Roberto Jaime Rodrigues (PAHO - WHO) and Dr. Lucila Ohno-Machado, with whom I have had the opportunity to carry out projects and research. Back in Brazil, I began to structure a specialization course and invest in the training of professionals in nursing informatics. One of the first priorities was to promote the candidacy of Brazil as host country for the World Congress of Informatics in Nursing (NI2003) of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA). Since 1991, I have been the representative of Brazil to the Special Interest Group in Nursing Informatics of IMIA, and thanks to this long-term participation, I was able to obtain the support of thirty-two other national representatives to help in our application. It involved intense preparation, since the competing countries were the United States, Canada and the UK. Our selection was a wonderful event, shared with colleagues who were in Seoul (South Korea) for MEDINFO\u201998, when the choice of the location of the next event was announced. The NI2003 was a success, and I had the feeling of having organized something very much like a MEDINFO, which is the largest congress of informatics in health organized by IMIA. Much of the international leadership in Medical Informatics was able to attend NI2003, including Hans Peterson, Patrice Degoulet, Jan van Bemmel, Marion Ball, Charles Safran, Reinhold Haux, Nancy Lorenzi, Edward Shortliffe, Vimla Patel, James Cimino, David Bates, KC Luck, Otto Rienhoff, and Reinhold Haux. They have all been instrumental in driving and consolidating the field of health informatics and I found myself having a hard time believing that I had managed to bring all these professionals together for this event in S\u00e3o Paulo. After NI2003 I assumed the presidency of the Brazilian Society of Informatics. This position represented for me a great responsibility and commitment to what my mentors had initiated. I have been working hard since I took over this society to obtain recognition of the field of healthcare informatics from the Brazilian organizations which support national research and the greater dissemination of technology and informatics in my country. In 2005, I organized the Electronic Patient Record Congress and I currently am organizing the 10th National  Congress on Health Informatics \u2013 XCBIS. Within the Nursing Department I have managed to maintain and update the computer laboratory of the Informatics Nucleus in Nursing for the use of all the students of the Department and teachers. From 1999 to 2015, I carried out research projects with Dr. Lucila Ohno Machado (Harvard Medical School and later at UC San Diego). Today we have a Specialization Course maintained by a project funded by the Fogarty International Institute of the National Library of Medicine, of the United States. In 2004 I was elected an International Member at the American College of Medical Informatics. Other positions also include being Chair (2009\u20132012) of the International Medical Informatics Association Nursing Informatics Special Interest Group (IMIA NI SIG), Chair of the International Chapter of TIGER Initiative. I have also applied for the \u201cLivre-Docente\u201d Tittle at the Medical School, State University of S\u00e3o Paulo (FM-USP). In 2015 after 12 years as Associate Editor of the International Journal of Medical Informatics, I became the Editor in Chief, succeeding Dr Charles Safran (Division of Medical Informatics, Harvard Medical School) and recognized as the first nurse to be the Editor in chief on this Journal. In 2016, I was invited to become a Senior Consultant for Innovation and Health IT at the S\u00edrio Liban\u00eas Hospital. Among other activities, I am also the Scientific Coordinator at ICT in Health Care, a research conducted at the Regional Center for Studies on the Development of Information Society (CETIC.BR). I recognize that I have been fortunate to have built a very extensive international network of colleagues in many countries, receiving invitations to give lectures, participate in committees, and conferences. In writing up my CV to qualify for a Full Professor Position, I look at all the activities I have done, and understand that none of this would have happened, were it not for the good friends and colleagues that I have been fortunate to meet during my academic journeys, which helped me grow from the seeds of valuing knowledge and culture, which my parents instilled in me. I have not taken my journeys alone: I owe more than I can say to my master\u2019s students, the colleagues and leaders of my University, who have understood and encouraged me in taking the paths I have followed in developing my experiences and insights in the field of health informatics and nursing. Nevertheless, the process has not been easy but believe that as result I can guide my students to be more well-rounded, efficient and competent professionals, offering my example and experience to them. As a professor, I have mentored over 20 PhD students, 32 Master\u2019s students, and 148 specialists in health and nursing informatics. To conclude, I have a strong conviction that our field is a most challenging but rewarding combination of professional graduate training in nursing with the technical and computer science knowledge for the informatics which I deeply believe will lead to the kinds of collaborative improvements in the quality of health care for both populations and individuals in my own country and around the globe. I am convinced that no machine will be ever able to replace the human capacity to offer a smile, a touch, a look of affection... These human expressions of caring can not be reproduced in a research laboratory and by automated systems. Never will the act of caring become obsolete. How to use technology and its resources to improve our human capabilities to feel and think is the challenge that lies ahead and that I have accepted. This is the concept that directs my academic and personal life and that I try to convey to my students, with all transparency and veracity that I am capable of. If I can educate so as to create more opportunities and experiences for my students, I will have fulfilled what I have chosen to apply\u2014the courage to teach, to learn to teach, to teach to care, to teach to be a better and more complete human being. ", "Alexa T. McCray": "Professor of Medicine Harvard Medical School Department of Biomedical Informatics & Division of Clinical Informatics, BIDMC Luck (very good luck!) best describes how I first became involved in the informatics field. Shortly after arriving at the National Library of Medicine as its new Director, Don Lindberg was looking for a computational linguist to join his yet-to-be named Unified Medical Language System project. I thought that sounded quite interesting, but I wasn\u2019t entirely sure that I qualified for the job. I did have a shiny, relatively new, PhD degree in A.T. McCray, Phd linguistics, and I had done a short research stint in natural language processing at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, but medical language processing was not one of my areas of strength (that is to say, I had no experience). Nonetheless, Don took a chance on me, and now thirty years later, I can say that it has been a great privilege to be part of this interesting, innovative, and active field. Shortly after arriving at the NLM, I was introduced to the entire Who\u2019s Who of the medical informatics field. The NLM Board room became the venue for animated discussions about the best way to solve the medical language problem. The leaders of virtually all of the medical informatics programs in the country attended regular meetings at the NLM, and they brought with them their best and brightest graduate and post- doctoral students. The goal was to get computers to \u201cunderstand\u201d medical language so that different systems would be able to \u201ctalk\u201d with each other. All of this pre-dated the Internet revolution which was still about a decade in the future. We made significant progress in those early years in defining the problem and in taking steps toward its solution. The result was the development and dissemination of the UMLS knowledge resources, including the Metathesaurus, which now interconnects more than 150 biomedical terminologies, the Semantic Network, which provides a unifying structure for the concepts represented in the UMLS, and the SPECIALIST lexicon and lexical tools, which are useful for biomedical language processing applications. Today, the UMLS integrates hundreds of thousands of biomedical concepts, making it possible, for example, to meaningfully interlink clinical systems, genomic databases, and the biomedical literature. In addition to the UMLS work, one of my first tasks was to develop a research program in natural language processing within NLM\u2019s research division, the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications. The wealth of resources available to us right at the NLM allowed us to make rapid progress. The Medical Subject Headings provided a gold mine of biomedical knowledge in computable form. MEDLINE provided an enormous database of biomedical text for experimentation, and the search specialists at NLM provided us with examples of particularly thorny search requests that they thought might benefit from automated processing. In the early 1990\u2019s, the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) decided to offer an annual Yearbook to its members. The Yearbook would select and  republish the best articles from the previous year in the informatics field and would also solicit review papers on timely topics. Jan van Bemmel and I were the inaugural editors, and we collaborated on the Yearbook for nearly a decade. The Yearbooks are still being published today, and they offer a window into the wide-ranging field of biomedical informatics. My work on the Yearbook gave me the opportunity to interact with many leaders in the international informatics community, and not only was that professionally broadening, it was wonderful to forge friendships with so many engaging, dedicated, and effective individuals from all over the world. Luck was also with me in the late 1990\u2019s when Harold Varmus, then the Director of the NIH, asked the NLM to develop a database of clinical trial information that had been mandated by U.S. Federal legislation (the FDA Modernization Act of 1997). I had the good fortune to be selected to develop the database, which we named ClinicalTrials.gov. It is fair to say that everything I had learned since arriving at the NLM in the mid 1980\u2019s was put to good use in the design and development of this resource. Basic informatics principles, the rich computable knowledge in the UMLS knowledge sources, and the astonishing technological advances of that era, all contributed to my ability to create what is now an international resource of clinical trials information for patients, researchers, and the general public. My work at NLM on publicly accessible resources led me to think more deeply about questions of access to health information. In reviewing the literature, it became clear to me that many health materials created for patients were, in fact, well beyond the health literacy levels of a large segment of the population. This was especially true of the vast amount of information available to patients on the Internet. Shortly after moving to Harvard Medical School in early 2005, I was invited to join an active health literacy group at Harvard. I collaborated with public health researchers and leaders of community health centers in Massachusetts to address health literacy issues, bringing my own informatics perspective to the problem. Recently, this work led to my participation in a U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine committee on science literacy and the public perception of science. The committee report challenges the traditional view that science literacy, including health literacy, is solely the property of an individual and argues instead that structural and other aspects of the larger society play an equally important role. I have had the chance to lead and collaborate on many challenging, interesting, and wide-ranging projects over the years. My approach to all of these projects has been heavily influenced by my early work on issues related to the optimal representation of biomedical knowledge. Most recently, I have been working with researchers from across the U.S. on a project, the Undiagnosed Diseases Network, that integrates clinical and genomic data to solve medical mysteries. The Network has expanded internationally, and I collaborate closely with all of my colleagues to ensure that the extensive data that we collect are standardized, computable, and comparable. Serendipity is responsible for my becoming a member of the biomedical informatics field. Continued good luck (with, perhaps, a bit of hard work) have contributed to the richness of the career that I have had. The scope of our field is broad and it, therefore, requires an interdisciplinary approach. This is both a challenge and an opportunity. It has been a challenge to define one unifying theoretical, methodological, and educational approach to the field. On the other hand, the field gives individuals with different, complementary expertise the opportunity to collaborate on resolving some of the most significant problems in biomedicine and health. I have been a direct beneficiary of this amazing opportunity. ", "Clem McDonald": "Director, Lister Hill Center, National Library of Medicine Past President, American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) Regenstrief Professor of Medical Informatics Distinguished Professor of Medicine, Indiana University Med School. The faculty at my medical school, the University of Illinois in Chicago included a large contingent of Boston City Hospital alumni, and they recommended that I apply to Harvard internship programs in Boston. So, I did and got into the program at Boston City. In my senior year of medical school, the same guys from Boston City said, \u201cYou should apply to NIH for a fellowship\u201d in the future, and so, I did. I applied for a job focused on mathematical modeling. At that time, I believed that you could accomplish anything with math. In the extreme, you could take Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s quantum mechanics equation, start with small molecules, join them together to make a cell, and finally, model a dog\u2014a whole \u201cliving\u201d dog. I was very na\u00efve. Today, giant computers cannot yet model more than a few dozen amino acids with Schrodinger\u2019s equation. I did not get that job, but the application eventually came to fruition. In my senior year of medical school, I did my first computer project. I read Homer Warner\u2019s 1961 JAMA article about computer diagnosis using Bayes theorem. Dr. William Best, a hematologist and a math and computer expert, from the nearby Chicago VA hospital was my mentor. We set out to diagnose the acute abdomen, which include diagnoses such as appendicitis and cholecystitis. The Bayes equation was easy to program, and all acute abdomen causes were described in a little book by Cope. The hard part was converting the narrative descriptions in Cope into the matrix of statistical probabilities required by Bayes. We had to guess. To obtain cases with which to test the system I began to abstract cases of the acute abdomen from medical charts. I only got through five abstracts before my senior medical school year ended, so the effort did not come to much. Boston City Hospital. I began my medical Internship at Boston City hospital in 1965. It was a wonderful, but grueling experience with very bright and motivated peers and fellows. Almost all beds were open wards. When assigned to the women\u2019s ward we had night duty every other night. That meant starting at 6:30 AM, staying through the night and finishing at 8:00 or 9:00 PM the next day. The effort was leavened by a night float intern, which meant we could get to bed about 3:00 AM on our night duty. As was true of most city/county hospitals\u2014staffing was meager and interns filled the gaps. The medical culture at Boston City was also very demanding. Interns were expected to produce, track down, gather, and then summarize all of the facts about their patients. We did all of the blood cell counts, urinalyses, and gram stain tests ourselves, drew all of the bloods for chemistry tests, maintained our own flow sheets, started most IVs, and portered patients down to get x-rays, donned lead aprons, and held them up to be sure to get a good upright chest view. We dug around the medical record room to find old charts, and when necessary, called pharmacies to get medication records, and neighbors to get a history. It could take 6 hours to work up one patient. We were data dredgers and ledger keepers, and spent way more time gathering data than caring for patients. In 1965,  computers were helping banks keep track of their customers\u2019 ledgers. It seemed like hospitals could track patients the same way. At Boston City, we had one pure outpatient rotation during which we worked a regular workday in the clinic, plus two evenings a week in the Emergency Room. It was a vacation. I heard about Octo Barnet\u2019s work with computers at Mass General. I was able to get an appointment with him, but not until the end of my outpatient rotation. I told him, \u201cI want to do a project with you during my internship.\u201d And, he chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re an intern at Boston City? Where are you going to get the time?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019ll work it out.\u201d Well, the next day, I returned to the inpatient service and my time door slammed shut; I didn\u2019t see Octo again for three years. Over the years, Octo and I became good friends and he deemed me one of his fellows based on that 30-minute meeting in 1965, and invited me to all of his fellows\u2019 crab fests during the annual AMIA meetings, which he hosted at Dancing Crab in DC. Northwestern University. Unbeknownst to me, my application to NIH remained active, and during my internship, I got a call from Dr. George Z. Williams, the head of Clinical Pathology at NIH\u2019s Clinical Center inviting me to be a NIH fellow in their department. They were developing one of the first computer-based laboratory systems, and thought I could be helpful. They were patient, so they also encouraged me to take the master\u2019s degree program in bioengineering at Northwestern University back in Chicago that I had been considering. I started that program in the summer of 1966 and took a ton of math and engineering courses. My first two master\u2019s thesis projects failed. The second and final one required computer programming. Realize that this was the era of punch-card computer programming. You submitted your job as a stack of IBM cards to the computer center. It came back in 2-4 hours, and then you fixed the errors by punching new cards, and resubmitted. It could take ten or more of these cycles just to find and fix the programs\u2019 syntax and logical errors, and even longer to print out diagnostic statements and the results. I did not understand how anyone one could ever complete a large computer project back then. nd By the time my second project had failed, I was half-way through my 2 year and I had way more credit hours than required for a masters\u2019 degree. So, I asked if I could just finish without a thesis, or just quit without the degree. The answer was an absolute \u201cno.\u201d The program director was determined to get at least one MD graduate, and I was the first one who had passed all of the math and engineering courses. For my last project, I returned to my medical school computer diagnosis project, reviewed 200 charts to find 72 patients who met my criteria for any of the nine acute abdomen diagnoses (appendicitis, acute cholecystitis, etc.), and applied two techniques to diagnose them: Bayes theorem, and a modified k-nearest neighbor rule, all programmed in FORTRAN. The best I was able to achieve was a 63% accuracy. NIH. Starting in \u201967, I spent a little over 2 years at NIH, in the Clinical Center's pathology department. I learned to program in machine language, wrote programs for the nursing service and helped to manage the project. The contractor was a company called DNA (no genetics involved). Dr. George Z. Williams and his colleagues were very good to me. They sent me on a grand tour of pioneering medical computer projects, including Weed\u2019s PROMIS lab at University of Vermont, Morris Collen\u2019s IBM project at Kaiser Permanente, Octo Barnet\u2019s project at Mass General (my second meeting), and Homer Warner\u2019s development at Latter Day Saints Hospital.  While at NIH, I came to learn about, and appreciate, the many beauties of the structures and algorithms used for storing, sorting and searching for data. There was a theory to it with its own beauty, even though it was not pure math. I was strongly influenced by the development of that lab system because most kinds of clinical data have the same structure as a laboratory result. If you can build a lab system, you should be able to build a whole EMR. And, Cerner, the successful developer of laboratory systems, did just that. After NIH, I planned to finish my medical residency. I wrote a long, detailed application to the chairman of the University of Illinois School of Medicine in Chicago telling him I wanted to work on electronic medical records during my residency and work with medical staff thereafter to finish it. He responded with a one-line note saying, \u201cYou come and be a resident, and when you finish, we\u2019ll talk.\u201d I considered that a non-response, went back to Chicago without a residency, or a full-time job. Rolf Gunnar, whom I knew from medical school as brilliant diagnostician and great teacher, had just taken over as chair of the Department of Medicine at Cook County hospital and was building the department up to be great in care, teaching, and research. He heard I was \u201cloose\u201d in the city, invited me to his office and said, \u201cClem, you can help us here and we will help you build your EMR.\u201d I had a great and intense clinical year at Cook County and intended to stay there indefinitely, but in June of that year Cook County was hit by a political cataclysm. \"They\" did not want high quality departments and forced out all of their strong departmental chairmen, including Dr. Gunnar. I saw no future there. About this time, Warner Slack, who had been developing a computerized patient history system at the U. of Wisconsin accepted a position with Howard Bleich at the Harvard Brigham and Woman\u2019s hospital. What followed was another link in my chain of fortunate connections. Dr. Robert Schilling\u2014of the \u201cSchilling\u2019s test\u201d fame, and also a Boston City hospital alumnae\u2014was the Chairman of Medicine at U of Wisconsin in Madison, and wanted to fill Slack\u2019s vacated position with a computer-skilled MD. Dr. Best, my mentor in medical school, was a friend of Schilling, knew what was happening at Cook County, and passed my name to Schilling, who offered me a residency slot. While there as a resident, I met John H. Griest\u2014a psychiatrist and computer guru originally from Indianapolis. He told me about the brand new Regenstrief Institute in Indianapolis and thought it might be the perfect place for me because it was part of Wishard, a city county hospital, the institute was interested in computer medicine, and Joe Mamlin, whom he thought was spectacular leader, was the Chief of Medicine at that hospital. On his advice, I visited Indianapolis, and ended up starting there in 1972, and staying there for 34 years. The Regenstrief early years. Sam Regenstrief \u201cinvented\u201d the low price dishwashing machine and in the \u201960\u2019s manufactured almost half of the world\u2019s dishwashers sold by Sears, Admiral, Philco, and 21 other companies. He had no children, never spent any money on himself, and thought healthcare was way too expensive. So in 1969, he worked with Dr. John Hickham to found the Regenstrief Institute at Wishard hospital. Its goal was to make healthcare more efficient and to use computers in support of that goal. Dr. Hickam, who was the beloved 22-year Chairman of Medicine at IU, took on the position of Regenstrief\u2019s founding director. Because Dr. Hickam died suddenly in 1970, Dr. Eugene Stead, who was his mentor, took over the directorship. Dr. Stead was Chairman of Duke University Department of Medicine and had trained almost half of all US medical schools\u2019 departments of medicine chairmen at that time. But, because the  school of Medicine at U of Illinois was led by Harvard, rather than Duke trained faculty, I had never heard of Dr. Stead. He was just this guy who came to the Institute now and then. One day, he asked me to his office and told me, \u201cClem, here is what you\u2019re gonna do\u2014you\u2019re gonna go around the state and set up care sites around the state. We are going to produce a great new care system.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m not doing that. I came here to work on computers at Wishard, not to drive all over the state!\u201d He got mad. He said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be a nothin\u2019! You\u2019ll be a nobody!\u201d But we came to be friends. Within a year or so, he invited me down to Duke University where I stayed in his home, and I met Bill, his son, in their kitchen. Bill was a junior in medical school and working with Ed Hammond on one of the pioneering EMRs, \u201cThe Medical Record\u201d (TMR). Dr. Joe Mamlin, the Chair of the Department of Medicine at Wishard Hospital, was the main draw for me at the Indiana U School of Medicine. He was a force of nature who pushed and protected my Regenstrief Medical Record System (RMRS) at Wishard and on the IU medical campus for 25 years. The work he did before and after he became chief at Wishard\u2019s medical service provides a measure of the man. Prior to IU, he was a Peace Corps physician volunteer in Jalalabad Afghanistan, helped found a medical school there, and wrote the first Afghan textbook of medicine in Pashtu. Following his retirement, he has organized the care for 150,000 AIDS patients in Kenya, was one of the first to urge treatment of existing cases as the best form of prevention and has become fluent in Swahili. He is a persuasive, effective, pragmatic, and deeply good, human being. I could never have succeeded without his aggressive support. At the beginning, I spent three months a year on the inpatient ward service, and three half days in the clinic per week, and an evening on ED duty once a month. From the day I arrived at Regenstrief in February of 1972, my goal was to develop an Electronic Medical Record, so I also had to find time to do that and to build a research agenda. I envisioned it would solve the logistics problems of the paper record, watch for patient states that needed action (reminders), and provide grist for research. For the first half year, our computer power came from a PDD-11-44 delivered over four slow telephone lines from Purdue University 60 miles away. But, within 9 months, we had our own PPD- 11-45 in Indianapolis, with 6 input lines. The machine had 10 Meg of disc memory and 64 K or RAM, which is tiny by today\u2019s standards, but was physically quite large. It was a time-sharing minicomputer with a very sophisticated BASIC language that reported formatting and logical errors immediately, as one entered the programming statements. No two-hour wait. It was heaven. We started the EMR with the diabetes clinic patients. We stamped smiley faces onto the addressograph plates of these patients, which then showed up on the carbon copies where results were recorded. Every afternoon we picked up the third carbon copy of every radiology and laboratory report to find the ones with smiley faces and entered them into the computer. The night before each clinic, we printed a turn-around encounter form and two other reports specific to each patient. The encounter form displayed the active medications, and diagnoses list, and had space for physicians to record new prescriptions test orders and problems, and to discontinue inactive ones. The second report was a flowsheet that carried all of a patients EMR data in time ordered matrices. This early system generated computer reminders (AKA decision support), placing some reminders on the encounter form where they could be \u201cordered\u201d by circling the ones they wanted to initiate, and others in a separate form. All three of these reports were placed on the top of the paper chart, where physicians saw and used them. They took to reviewing the EMR flowsheet encounter form for most chart information.  With only four computer access ports, our paper-based approach was the only feasible one. However, physicians liked the paper because it didn\u2019t require any special effort by them. By June of 1973, our EMR was operational in the diabetes clinic with 480 patients. We randomized providers and showed a strong effect of reminders on care process. We submitted the first version of that study to The New England Journal of Medicine. Franz Ingelfinger, the editor of the journal wrote the rejection letter himself. It was a very kind and encouraging 2-page single space letter. He said, \u201cWell, we can\u2019t publish it, but this looks like really interesting work that you ought to pursue.\u201d The Annals of Internal Medicine did accept that first study. By 1974, we had the system working in the medicine clinic and performed another larger study with more sophisticated reminders and showed a similar sized effect as the first. That study became our \u201cNonperfectibility of man\u201d study, which was accepted and published by the New England Journal of Medicine. That paper opened many doors, and it re-enforced the need to study medical information systems through randomized trials. We did many more such studies, including huge 2-year study of reminders with 12K patients in the medicine clinic. More connections: Howard Bleich, who had recruited Warner Slack to Harvard, was a reviewer on the \u201cNon-perfectibility of man\u201d paper and gave it a glowing review. Then, he invited me to Boston where I met most of the Boston informatics intelligentsia. He also recommended me for membership on an important study section and was a special support for my career. Reed Gardner invited me to Utah in the same timeframe. He and others from LDS became my long-term friends. Over the next 12+ years, the computers supporting the RMRS morphed into a large cluster of VAX 780 computers that connected hundreds of terminals for EMR look-ups everywhere in the institution, and also supported our own home-grown laboratory, pharmacy, and clinic scheduling system. Though we had used terminals frequently for online look-up, physicians still used the paper-based documents in the clinics. By 1982, it became obvious that we could not sustain the data capture effort with home-developed ancillary service systems, plus our spit and bailing wire data capture mechanisms. We needed electronic message standards and began to agitate for them. In 1984, we arranged an AMIA panel of likeminded researchers, and out of that meeting, the ASTM standard organization agreed to host a clinical message standards effort. At that 1984 meeting, we published a data structure close to what was finally adopted in the ASTM standard (1238-88), and with help from Don Simborg and Wes Rishel, became the core of HL7\u2019s orders and observations chapter. By 1993, most medical systems vendors were supporting the HL7 observation message standard, and the work of maintaining and expanding the RMRS became much easier. In the 1984 to 1986 timeframe, we began developing a physicians\u2019 workstation, with help from Joe Mamlin\u2019s son, Burke, for order entry, real-time reminders (decision support) and eventually physician note entry. This was a slow \u201corganic\u201d process that evolved over seven years, starting with laboratory tests ordering in one medical clinic where Bill Tierney and I studied the effect of presenting test charges, probability of getting a positive test result, and a short summery of old results, respectively. All of these interventions reduced the physicians\u2019 test ordering. We then expanded to the whole medicine clinic, to the writing of all orders including prescriptions, and to all clinics. Finally, in the 1990s, we expanded the use of the workstation to the inpatient medicine service. Bill Tierney, who was the lead of many of the workstation studies, initiated a large 20-month (5000+ patients) study of its overall effect, that was published in JAMIA  in 1993. Over the subsequent years, we expanded the workstation\u2019s scope to all of the other hospital services, added a note writing option, and performed many more studies. With one PC workstation per user, the system was always fast (1/10 second form field to field) and after the break-in period, most providers were enthusiastic. The software for the workstations was \u201cRevelation\u201d, a PC version of the Pick operating system. Like MUMPS, it had its own database system, but it ran on Novell\u2019s network. Revelation BASIC had a just in time complier. Its routines were fast, and Burke made them faster with a handful of assembly language routines. Revelation was very easy to develop in. The speed was always fast because each user had their own dedicated computer. We made it easy for physicians to find the names of the orders and problems they were looking for, by including rich synonymy, providing specialized menus by setting, specialty and current problem. One of our important \u201cinventions\u201d was pizza lunches, where we learned from the house staff, complaints and problems so we could fix them quickly. In 1993, we began to build a citywide medical record (with a grant from NLM) to which the major hospitals would deliver laboratory and other medical record content via HL7 messages to central EMR database, but segregated by institution\u2014we called it the Indianapolis Network for Patient Care (INPC). We started providing data that we had to all of the Emergency Departments in the city. We received a second grant from NLM and Marc Overhage MD, expanded the project to all 13 hospitals in Indianapolis, and then to most of the hospitals in Indiana. This was the first Health Information Exchange system (HIE). At present, the INPC carries more than 6 billion results for more than 6 million Indiana patients. To really make the healthcare exchanges work, we needed one more standard. HL7 does not specify the codes used to identify each test and measure reported via its Observation message. So each institution tended to invent their own set of such codes. To make it feasible to combine data from many institutions in one EMR database, we needed standard database of codes and names for observations such as Diastolic blood pressure and Serum glucose concentration. In 1994, we set out to define such a database, which we called LOINC, and delivered the first set of about 5000 codes in 1995. LOINC\u2019s use has grown slowly but steadily over the years. All of the major referral laboratories offers LOINC codes in the HL7 report messages. More than 20 countries, including the US require its use in some context. And language translations are available for more than 12 languages including all the major European ones, simplified Chinese, Turkish, Russian, and Korean. The FDA\u2019s new requirement for its use to identify laboratory results in clinical trial submissions and encouragement of IICC\u2019s standard by which instruments vendors can specify the mappings from their internal codes to LOINC codes are accelerants to the adoption of LOINC. ", "Julie J. McGowan": "Emeritus Professor, Indiana University School of Medicine Retired Research Scientist, Regenstrief Institute Fellow, American Medical Informatics Association Fellow, Medical Library Association Knowledge Informatics and HIE A basic precept of Library Science is the provision of relevant information when and where it is needed. I went to college, majoring in art and philosophy with great aspirations of becoming a medical illustrator. However, I needed to support my education and worked in the college library, falling love with books and the organization of knowledge. Realistic art was not popular in the 1960\u2019s so I was persuaded to pursue a master\u2019s degree in library and information science (M.L.S.), giving me my first introduction to computers. After finishing my required course in computers and writing my Fortran program using keypunch cards loaded into a Univac mainframe, unlike other biomedical informaticians, I could not imagine that computers would ever play a role in my future. Over my forty-year career, I have had direct or indirect responsibility for medical libraries in four different medical schools; the one major theme embedded in virtually all of my work in these institutions is encapsulated in the confluence of knowledge informatics and health information exchange (HIE). As an initial faculty member in two emergent medical schools, the University of South Alabama College of Medicine and the University of South Carolina School of Medicine, I came into contact with Betsy Humphries at the National Library of Medicine. Through her vision and support, I became responsible for developing medical journal holdings lists in libraries across the Southeastern United States; these lists contributed to the development of SERHOLD, the initial backbone for PubMed and electronically sharing medical information contained in journal literature across the United States. In my first two medical schools, I did not have the benefit of a medical informatics mentor and was forced to develop new skills and invent ways to accomplish my goals of facilitating the exchange of the knowledge contained in the health literature. Beyond becoming an expert in \u201cprogramming\u201d keypunch machines, I pulled coax and shielded twisted pair cables for Local Area Networking, soldered RS-232 connectors, and learned MUMPS as a programming language to facilitate management of library information systems. After twenty years and the completion of two additional degrees (M.A. and Ph.D.), I moved to Vermont in 1991 where two things impacted the direction of my career. First, I met Dr. Larry Weed, one of the earliest proponents of medical practice founded on pertinent evidence, and then I was accepted as a fellow into the inaugural class of the Woods Hole medical informatics course organized by the National Library of Medicine and bringing together physicians and librarians. Through these two encounters, I learned the importance of having individual patient record data linked to knowledge informed by validated research. Concomitantly, I saw the value of having all necessary information in the hands of the provider during the patient encounter.  The first major project I led was the creation of VTMEDNET, cited by JAMA as the first comprehensive state-wide health information network in the United States. Very simply, VTMEDNET provided physicians across the state of Vermont with access to their patients\u2019 electronic medical records, knowledge-based information, public health information, government information as it related to health care reform in the state, and email. While this concept became mundane in the Twenty-first Century, VTMEDNET was considered revolutionary at the time, considering that it predated the Web and access was primarily through dial-access modems. The project was designed initially in response to a Request for Proposals (RFP) issued by the National Library of Medicine. The proposal got good scores but was not funded. However, Vermont had a special environment that enabled achieving most of the goals of VTMEDNET by leveraging existing resources. Vermont\u2019s only academic medical center contributed a modem bank and email accounts, Vermont\u2019s hospital association agreed to provide technical computer support for the state\u2019s rural physicians, and Vermont\u2019s medical association provided one year of free access to all of the state\u2019s physicians through their membership. Because I had a joint appointment in the University of Vermont College of Medicine as a Professor of Pediatrics, I was able to present training at Grand Rounds in all of the state\u2019s hospitals, and by the end of the first year of operation, over 60% of the state\u2019s physicians were using the system on a routine basis. The success of VTMEDNET was primarily based on one thing. Rather than the academic medical center deciding what the rural physicians needed, the physicians were surveyed as to their top priorities for the state-wide health information network, understanding that more applications could be added later. Most of the critical applications were on both the physicians\u2019 and medical center\u2019s lists (E.G., access to the EHR, access to knowledge-based information, access to public health information). However, one application, the immunization registry, near the top of the medical center list, was not rated highly by the rural physicians and was not included in the initial system. The physicians, the initial target audience, got what they wanted, and they reciprocated by actively using the system. VTMEDNET served much later as a virtual foundation for the state\u2019s extant state-wide health information network. After nine years in Vermont, my career in biomedical informatics changed dramatically when I relocated to Indiana University as an Associate Dean and Department Chair in the School of Medicine and a biomedical informatics researcher in the Regenstrief Institute. In Vermont, I was one of two biomedical informaticians in the entire state and Larry Weed had left the medical school a decade earlier. In Indiana, I was surrounded by biomedical and health informatics colleagues and was fortunate to have the mentorship of Drs. Clem McDonald and Bill Tierney. Under their leadership, I was given the opportunity to play major roles in a number of different initiatives, including the Indiana IAIMS (Integrated Area Information Management System), the Indiana Program of Excellence in Biomedical Computing, and the National Resource Center (NRC) for Health Information Technology through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. However, the major focus my work was through the opportunities offered by IHIE, the Indiana Health Information Exchange, in collaboration with Dr. Marc Overhage, and through my evaluation studies, primarily of biomedical informatics initiatives, under the auspices of the NRC and within the context of the Clinical and Translational Sciences Awards of the National Institutes of Health. These provided the bases for the formulation of future challenges and opportunities in the areas of my research.  Health information exchange is critical to bringing together patterns of patient problems and patterns of resulting care, both for the individual patient and for patient cohorts. Many HIE initiatives are driven by large date repositories and this \u201cbig\u201d data offers the perfect venue for medical research of the future. Relevant information provided to health care providers when and where it is needed is now taking a new and more exciting form. Rather than just based on small prospective research studies, data mining of large data sets can establish relationships among genomic data, environmental influences across the globe, and medical problems in a way not envisioned when HIE was first conceived. The grand challenges of today relate to the problems encountered through establishing and controlling health information exchange and the politics surrounding access to HIE. Mining big data has two major limiting factors. The first is dependent upon the researchers\u2019 ability to ask the right questions, or have the opportunity to see patterns through data browsing. The second is dependent upon the quality of the data. This is grounded in insuring that the information contained in the medical record is accurate and complete and that the data acquired from the HIE is appropriate for the research question. The politics are much harder to anticipate and potentially even harder to address. While these differ internationally, it will take the international biomedical and health informatics community through the leadership of the International Medical Informatics Association to ensure that such data is available to researchers. Biomedical and health informatics is at the nexus for the next generation of world health through the provision of extant information when and where it is needed for patient health and medical care but also in the facilitation of research on the prevention and management of current and future diseases. Today\u2019s challenges are tomorrow\u2019s victories for a healthy world population. Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 2008; 15:297-301 ", "Blackford Middleton": "Chief Informatics and Innovation Officer Apervita, Inc. Past Chair: CPRI, HIMSS, AMIA During medical school at SUNY Buffalo, and later during internal my medicine residency at the University of Connecticut, I had two formative experiences that ignited my interest in clinical informatics. The first was to work with a professor of biomedical engineering [get name] who encouraged my interest in computers. Having already trained in public health / B. Middleton, MD, MPH, MSc, FACP, FACMI, FHIMSS, FIAHSI epidemiology I was familiar with computers for large data set analyses, but as a medical student I became convinced there must be better way than copying data from one machine and entering it into another for clinicians. In my bioengineering research elective, I read up on \u2018clinical computing\u2019 and discovered the word informatics. I was hooked. During this elective, I envisioned an \u2018electronic clipboard\u2019 that would replace the paper-based clipboard I was carrying around to copy data from one computer system to another. I even wrote a letter to HP and Apple outlining some of these ideas\u2014and never heard back (to no surprise!). This interest resulted in my first publication in the field. The second formative opportunity was in another elective during residency training. I worked with Dr. Dale Matthews who had an interest in decision making, and he introduced me to expert systems for differential diagnosis. I became familiar with QMR in detail and was the resident who brought it to Morning Report to help with forming differentials and discussion. Dale also sponsored me to attend MEDINFO in 1986, in Washington, D.C. I will never forget the presentations by Prof Edward Feigenbaum on digital libraries, and Glenn Rennels on \u201cRoundsman.\u201d I also sought out the Stanford folks in attendance and met up with Mark Musen and others for breakfast. I was hooked again. During my AHCPR Fellowship at Stanford I focused on clinical decision making and expert systems. There was a \u2018Bayesian mafia\u2019 of a sort at Stanford at the time with Greg Cooper (my advisor), David Heckerman, Eric Horvitz, Max Henrion, Malcolm Pradhan, Eddie Herskovitz, Harold Lehmann, and my research partner Mike Shwe. We had a load of fun making the QMR-Decision Theoretic (QMR-DT) version of QMR \u2013 many interesting challenges in the knowledge translation and acquisition process from QMR to QMR-DT, the need for simplifying approaches for inference across a large belief network, and an evaluation component measuring performance on Scientific American clinical cases. At the same time, I began to develop interest in my second major research area: the value of information (thanks to David Heckerman for doing all the math), or more generally the value of healthcare IT. Post-fellowship, I was lucky to be able to continue some of the Bayesian research in the Institute for Decision Systems Research which Max Henrion and I founded in Palo Alto. We dove further into some of the knowledge engineering challenges with belief nets. For my day job, I became the Medical Director of Inforamation Management Technology at Stanford\u2014one of the first CMIO type jobs of its kind. In this role, I was educated in all of the practical aspects of designing, introducing, and evaluating CISs in  complex clinical settings. Working with Don Simborg, Quinn Whiting-O\u2019Keef and the team at Bell Atlantic Health Systems we created the first clinical data repository at Stanford. Another interesting project during this time was the Bay Area Community Health and Education Network (BAYCHEN) funded by Pac-Bell to do some early telemedicine type experiments with a local nursing home, and radiologists in Singapore. Living in the Bay Area during this time it was hard to ignore the massive run-up in Internet start-ups. I decided to jump to the \u2018dark side\u2019 and joined Mark Leavitt and the team at MedicaLogic. Here, we created an EMR designed \u2018by doctors for doctors\u2019 known as Logician, had perhaps the first commercial PHR Aboutmyhealth.com, and even had a completely cloud-based EMR \u201cLogician Internet\u201d in the late 90\u2019s. Just a decade or so too early! MedicaLogic merged with Medscape, and then was sold to GE where Logician became \u201cGE Office Centricity.\u201d I was lucky to be recruited by David Bates and John Glaser to the Brigham and Womens\u2019 Hospital, Partners Healthcare, and joined the faculty at Harvard Medical School. At Partners, I was the Director of Clinical Informatics R&D following in the footsteps of Gil Kuperman, and Jonathan Teich before him. This was a fantastic opportunity with immense support from Dave and John to innovate. We grew a sizable team, were very lucky with both intramural and extramural funding, and built a lot of cool stuff (too numerous to count). Most of the work focused on clinical decision support, knowledge engineering, and knowledge dissemination at some level. Perhaps the highlight was 5 years of AHRQ funding to build the Clinical Decision Support Consortium where we developed novel cloud-based methods for CDS insertion into EMR, knowledge translation and specification, and stood up a first of its kind publically accessible knowledge repository (the KM Portal). During this time, I also was invited to create the Center for IT Leadership at Partners where we focused on value-based technology assessment. This was also a lot of fun building large stochastic simulation models with Eric Pan, Doug Johnston, Colene Byrne, Julia Adler-Milstein, Jan Walker, and others looking at what the evidence and expert opinion would suggest could be the value of health IT. Most notable papers from the C!TL include the Value of Ambulatory Computer-based Order Entry, The Value of Healthcare Information Exchange and Interoperability, as well as other studies on the value of PHR, chronic IT-enabled diabetes management, and telemedicine. I was recruited to join the faculty at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and served as CIO for the health system. This was a good experience to see more of the \u2018big picture\u2019 of IT management and services, but I was drawn back toward a more R&D oriented role\u2014I elected to join Paul Magelli who had been one of my students in Boston at an HSPH continuing education course\u2014Leadership Strategies for Health IT. Paul founded Apervita to \u2018democratize healthcare data and analytics\u2019 following in many ways along the lines of our work at the CDS Consortium. It is another rocket ride on the vendor side, building CDS and other advanced analytics at industry scale to help transform healthcare and build the learning healthcare system. I have been blessed with outstanding mentors and many outstanding colleagues across the years\u2014and been able to \u2018give back\u2019 through volunteer roles at HIMSS (Chair 2005-6), the NCVHS, NQF, AMIA (Chair 2015-16), and CAHIIM Health Informatics Accreditation Council Commissioner. It was fun to start the Physician\u2019s Symposium at HIMSS and see the ABPM CI Board Certification come to life at AMIA. Further, I\u2019ve been blessed with a wife and family who have tolerated the long hours, travel, and my endless enthusiasm for clinical informatics. I\u2019ve seen our field come from the ivory tower to the bedside, and even into the home. I\u2019ve had\u2014and continue to have\u2014a blast! ", "Randolph A. Miller": "Professor Emeritus, Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Founding Chair, Vanderbilt Department of Biomedical Informatics Past President/Board Chair AMIA; Past President ACMI Editor-in-Chief, JAMIA, 2002-2010 My career in academic medicine began in 1949, when I was born at a University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine teaching hospital. A quarter century later, I delivered babies there as a medical student. After completing medical school and residency in internal medicine at the R.A. Miller, MD, FACMI University of Pittsburgh, I joined the faculty as an Assistant Professor of Medicine in 1979. As an academic general internist, I directly provided care to patients for the next quarter century. Concurrently, I conducted clinical informatics research. In 1985, I founded (as its Chief) the Section of Medical Informatics in the Division of General Medicine. The Section grew to become a basis for Pitt\u2019s current Department of Biomedical Informatics. The final 25 years of my academic career took place at Vanderbilt University. In 1993-94, Dr. William (Bill) Stead recruited me to become Chair of Vanderbilt\u2019s new Section of Biomedical Informatics. When the Section evolved to become the Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) in 2001, I served as its founding Chair. Throughout my career, I have been honored to work with incredibly talented and dedicated colleagues whom I often found to be more capable than myself. I mention many of them herein and apologize for not being all-inclusive. I was fortunate to have my first exposure to informatics as a teenager in the 1960s, when I attended high school in suburban Pittsburgh. A Cornell University engineering graduate taught physics there. He convinced the school district to purchase and install an LGP-30 minicomputer. The LGP-30 used paper tape and toggle switches for I/O, had attached teletype output, and had drum memory. I wrote my first programs in machine code during 1964-65. A year later, that teacher arranged for us to access the Burroughs B5500 computer at nearby Westinghouse Research Laboratories. I then learned to program in Algol, using Hollerith punch cards to submit programs. From 1967-1972, I worked summers as a Fortran programmer. That afforded intellectually stimulating, well-paying jobs that were air-conditioned. At Princeton University from 1967-1971, I majored in Physics. Rigorous training in physics enhanced my analytical problem-solving abilities and facilitated my subsequent career. Many early pioneers in our field had a background in physics. Since childhood, I\u2019ve had multiple allergies. As a result, I initially planned to specialize in allergy/immunology after medical school. Then, serendipity intervened. After my freshman year, I worked in an immunology professor\u2019s research laboratory. When we worked with mice, I developed allergic rhinitis. When we worked with rabbits, I had asthma. At the end of the summer, the professor advised me to avoid any research career that involved working with laboratory animals. By chance, at that time, I learned from colleagues about interesting new research led by Dr. Jack Myers, who had recently stepped down after an illustrious career as Chairman of Medicine (1955-1970) at Pitt. He was working with a brilliant young computer scientist, Harry E. Pople, Jr., to develop  an artificial intelligence (AI) approach to clinical diagnosis. Harry had an appointment in Pitt\u2019s School of Business. He had recently completed his PhD at Carnegie-Mellon University under two leading AI pioneers: Allen Newell and future Nobel Prize winner Herbert Simon. In March 1973, I joined Myers\u2019s and Pople\u2019s diagnosis project as a volunteer programmer. I learned LISP (accessing a BBN computer in Boston) and later PDP-10 assembly language (connecting to the SUMEX-AIM facility at Stanford via an Internet precursor). At that time, Pople and Myers were abandoning an initial deductive logic approach to diagnosis that had been based on Harry\u2019s PhD work. I devoted full-time to the project during a Spring 1973 research elective and the ensuing summer months. I participated in the team\u2019s critical discussions that led, at Myers\u2019s suggestion, to adopting a more empirical approach to diagnosis\u2014attributing findings to diseases directly, rather than through intermediate pathophysiological states. The project was initially named DIALOG (for diagnostic logic) but later renamed INTERNIST-1 after lawyers warned us that Lockheed had already created a DIALOG system. During a 1974-75 sabbatical year from medical school, I completed the equivalent of a pre-doctoral fellowship in clinical informatics. I worked under Pople and Myers to develop the INTERNIST-1 knowledge base (KB) editor program. Dr. Myers offered an elective medical student rotation in clinical diagnosis. Students selected a disease topic of interest and spent 2-3 weeks full-time reviewing the peer-reviewed literature on diagnosis of the disorder. I substantially increased my knowledge of internal medicine by participating in the seminars where students presented their literature findings to Dr. Myers. Myers never forgot anything he read\u2014and would often correct the students\u2019 reports from memory. He would then send them back to the library for additional literature review. Once approved, the information was entered into the INTERNIST-1 KB. Despite his vast knowledge, Myers insisted that the KB be grounded in the peer- reviewed literature and not on anecdotal opinions of experts. His logical approach to clinical diagnosis inspired me to choose internal medicine as a clinical specialty. His advice regarding undertaking residency training versus a PhD was critical to my career: \u201cIf you want to assist clinicians, you need to maintain sufficient medical knowledge to understand the problems they face at their level. Only then can you develop appropriate solutions. Otherwise, your work will lose relevance and credibility over time.\u201d As a new faculty member in 1979, I gained two influential mentors (in addition to Myers): Dr. Michael Karpf, then Chief of the Division of General Internal Medicine, and Dr. Wishwa Kapoor, a valued colleague who later succeeded Dr. Karpf as Division Chief. They encouraged and supported my subsequent research at Pitt involving implementing and evaluating clinical informatics systems. I also joined Dr. Myers and Pitt faculty member Dr. Kenneth Schaffner, a renowned philosopher of science, to develop an elective course for second-year medical students (J Med Ed, 1982). With the students, we discussed diagnostically challenging cases from clinical and logical perspectives, then analyzed the cases using the INTERNIST-1 system to provide a contrasting viewpoint. In 1981-82, with Drs. Myers and Pople, I conducted one of the earliest evaluations of a diagnostic expert system, INTERNIST-1 (N Engl J Med, 1982). While that study demonstrated impressive performance, it more importantly categorized shortcomings of the system. I spent the next decade refining, improving, and evaluating diagnostic decision support systems. In 1984-90, working with Dr. Fred E. (Chip) Masarie, Jr., I created and evolved one of the first microcomputer-based diagnostic systems, Quick Medical Reference (QMR). We introduced a clinical decision support paradigm shift  from the earlier \u201comniscient Greek oracle\u201d model (Meth Inform Med, 1990). The new approach, rather than treating the clinician-user as a passive data gatherer, recognized the user\u2019s intelligence and goals as essential components of a diagnostic consultation (Ann Intern Med, 1989). The QMR system embodied efficient, focused methods to address specific types of problems that could occur during the diagnosis process. One of those novel methods, the QMR Relationships function, addressed the question, \u201cgiven a set of 1-4 patient findings, what single disorder or set of causally interrelated disorders can explain all of the findings?\u201d At MEDINFO \u201992, I received a Gold Medal for presentation of that work. In 1984, I began several decades of work related to ethical and legal issues in the use of clinical systems (Ann Intern Med, 1985 and 1997). I was the founding Principal Investigator (PI) for the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s National Institutes of Health\u2013sponsored informatics training programs (1987) and later, for Vanderbilt (2001). Several of our trainees published their research in prominent medical journals. For my work on clinical decision support, I received the University of Utah\u2019s first Priscilla Mayden Prize in Medical Informatics. As PI of the Pitt\u2019s National Library of Medicine sponsored Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) project, I collaborated with Jerry Osheroff, MD, and anthropologist Diana Forsythe, PhD, on a landmark participant observation study characterizing the information needs of clinical practice (Ann Intern Med, 1991). Later, our UMLS project team (Chip Masarie, Nunzia Giuse, Omar Bouhaddou, Homer Warner, and myself) demonstrated the utility of a frame-based interlingua system for translating clinical vocabulary concepts among geographically disparate systems (Comp Biomed Res, 1991). I also worked with Dr. John Vries, a brilliant neurosurgeon at Pitt, who developed the MARS electronic health record (EHR) that served as a key institutional system for several decades. Early in my career, Dr. Myers related that during his transition to Chair of Medicine at Pitt in 1955, he had made certain to bring with him enough talented colleagues to ensure success. As I moved to Vanderbilt in 1994, I recruited a nucleus of individuals from Pittsburgh who played critical roles in the later success of Vanderbilt\u2019s Department of Biomedical Informatics: Nunzia Giuse; Dario Giuse, PhD (a brilliant yet pragmatic CMU faculty computer scientist); and post-doctoral trainees Antoine Geissb\u00fchler, MD, and Steve Brown, MD. With Bill Stead\u2019s visionary institutional leadership and support, our first decade at Vanderbilt emphasized user-centered design, implementation, and evaluation of large- scale clinical information systems. Those systems played a vital role in healthcare delivery at Vanderbilt over the following two decades. Dario Giuse spearheaded work on the StarPanel EHR system with integrated decision support, written from scratch in Perl. Antoine Geissb\u00fchler led development of the WizOrder Care Provider Order Entry (CPOE) system with integrated decision support\u2014written from scratch in C++. I helped advise and design clinical system development and led efforts to deploy the systems at Vanderbilt Hospital. Steve Brown assumed leadership in the informatics activities of the Vanderbilt-affiliated Nashville Veterans Administration facility. After serving as President/Board Chair of AMIA in 1994-95, I worked with Reed Gardner, PhD, of the University of Utah, to develop a consortium of professional organizations. We received a 1997 FDA Commissioner\u2019s Special Citation for our work on recommending guidelines for monitoring and regulation of clinical software systems (Ann Intern Med, 1997; J Am Med Inform Assoc, 1997). In 1999, Vanderbilt University Medical Center\u2019s CEO raised concerns about the financial future of the clinical enterprise. Resource utilization costs were outpacing income. He created a committee comprised of clinical department chairs (medicine,  pediatrics, pathology, radiology, etc.)\u2014with me representing biomedical informatics\u2014 to review the situation and make recommendations. An analysis of CPOE log data indicated that many tests and imaging studies had been ordered to repeat without set termination dates. For example, some ICU patients had received daily portable chest xrays for weeks. We designed CPOE-based interventions that dramatically reduced costs (Ann Intern Med, 2004). I served as Joshua Denny\u2019s mentor for development of KnowledgeMap (JAMIA, 2003). That work facilitated Josh\u2019s subsequent pioneering PheWAS research. In 2004, I received Vanderbilt\u2019s William J. Darby Award for Translational Research. Based on my innovative work in clinical informatics, I was elected in 2006 to membership in the Institute (now National Academy) of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. I later received the 2007 AMIA Lindberg Innovation award and the 2008 Distinguished Alumnus Award from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. After Antoine Geissb\u00fchler returned to his native Switzerland in 2001, DBMI faculty members Douglas Talbert, PhD, and Russell Waitman, PhD, capably succeeded him. They collaborated with me and Bill Stead to guide further institutional CPOE development, implementation, and maintenance. Nancy Lorenzi, PhD, worked with Dario Giuse to roll out increasingly more sophisticated components of the StarPanel EHR system. After serving as JAMIA Editor (2002-2010), I decided to resume my earlier research on clinical diagnosis. The INTERNIST-1 and QMR systems had been mainframe- and microcomputer-based applications that were inconvenient for practicing clinicians to use during patient care. I realized that the advent of smartphone and tablet technology provided a viable platform for future accessible clinical decision support. From 2010 to 2014, I reformulated the INTERNIST-1/QMR KB for the iOS environment and created new KB structures extending its utility. I learned to program in Objective-C and subsequently, Swift. Working with DBMI graduate student Matthew Lenert, I have recently created a new iOS-based (iPhone/iPad) series of apps, grouped under the umbrella designation VanderbiltDDx. The first product in the series, VanderbiltDDx Quiz (developed by Matt Lenert), was released as a free-of-charge App from the Vanderbilt iOS App Store in June 2019. The forthcoming VanderbiltDDx Case Simulator App will help users to practice and refine their diagnostic skills. It creates realistic, easy-to-evaluate adult patient cases. The intended audience includes medical, nursing, and other health professional students; physicians undergoing residency and fellowship training; nurses in advanced practice training; and practicing health professionals. The third App in the series, planned for the 2020-21 time frame, will be an iOS-based complete revision of the INTERNIST-1/QMR diagnostic decision support system, with additional new features. I also plan to spend time in my retirement revising and updating the knowledge base. I was fortunate to recruit then-future DBMI Chair Dr. Kevin Johnson to our faculty in 2000. A critical task for all leaders is to recruit and train next-generation successors who are more capable than themselves. I regret that our field prematurely convinced the United States Government to require widespread adoption of what were suboptimal EHR systems in hospitals and clinics. Commercial vendors\u2019 systems were not as easy to use, nor as focused on expediting clinicians\u2019 work, as the leading academic systems at the time. Difficult-to-use systems have significantly impaired care delivery and frustrated clinicians. Our greatest current challenge is to remedy that problem. ", "Jochen R. Moehr": "PPrrooffeessssoorr, DDrr.. Mmeedd.. PPrrooffeessssoorr EEmmeerriittuuss,, SScchhooooll ooff HHeeaalltthh IInnffoorrmmaattiioonn SScciieennccee UUnniivveerrssiittyy ooff VViiccttoorriiaa During the eighth year of their marriage, my parents, Kurt Karl Robert Moehr, a pharmacist working in the pharmaceutical industry, and Irmgard, his wife produced me as their firstborn in 1939 in Shanghai. Keen to show off the new family member, they went to Germany in 1941, using the Trans-Siberian Express, as the sea route was considered too dangerous. But when Hitler attacked Russia, they were stranded in increasingly war governed Germany. As soon as I gained consciousness there in the early 1940\u2019s, I exhibited a profound interest in everything natural. I was blessed to grow up in a small Bavarian village near the Alps, to which we had been evacuated, when the bombs started to rain on German cities. Here I grew up amid unspoiled nature in a world without mechanized traffic, bare foot in a universe that had a radius of three kilometers. By nature, close to the ground I was appreciative of the lilies, orchids, gentians and butterflies along the way. Soon, I knew that I wanted to become a \u201cNaturforscher\u201d, which then became \u201cZoologist\u201d, but by the time I reached my teens, my parents and a very esteemed zoologist friend, Dr. Otto Wagner in Bremen, convinced me that studying Medicine would be more prudent. So, with the generous support of my father, I studied Medicine, mostly in Marburg, Germany, and for one year in Montpellier, France. Back from France in 1962, I started working on my dissertation in clinical enzymology, with Professors Ellen and Fritz- Werner Schmidt, investigating \u201cthe release of cellular enzymes from the isolated perfused rat liver under the influence of various poisons.\u201d Some of my results were puzzling. To unravel what was happening with the release of enzymes, measured by their metabolic activity, which could be activated or quenched I needed the help of mathematicians at the Bayer pharmaceutical company who had access to computers (in 1963!) to interpret what was happening. This experience left me humbled and longing to acquire the computer skills desirable to solve such puzzles. That opportunity arose after graduating, when I lucked into an almost two-year sojourn at what is now Rush University Medical College in Chicago. My original purpose was to learn \u201cultra-micro biochemical assay\u201d methods from Prof. Hermann Mattenheimer. But I happened upon a more productive project: Professor Fritz W. Deinhardt had just produced a first animal model for human hepatitis by transferring hepatitis A to marmoset monkeys, which eventually led to the development of a vaccine. Since my dissertation in Marburg had provided me with the methods to investigate some aspects of this model, I concentrated on comparing its pathophysiology with that of human hepatitis. Beyond that, the sojourn in Chicago allowed me to take courses in statistics and an introduction to computers, and\u2014above all\u2014to an environment which not only regularly hosted conventions of such austere organizations as the AAAS, but also featured eight medical universities/colleges with incessant inspiring interaction.  Back in Germany, in 1967, with the team of Profs. E. & F.W. Schmidt at the newly created Hannover Medical School (Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, MHH), I completed my medical internship. For me, this was a discouraging experience, with exhausting around the clock service, which did not prevent the loss of yet another young patient suffering of Hodgkins disease and yet another senior succumbing to self-induced alcoholic liver cirrhosis. It left me longing for a more effective way to spend my life. Unfortunately, my attempts to gain inroads on computers were at least as frustrating as my clinical experiences. The attempt to learn ALGOL at the Technical University of Hannover on the basis of a lecture explaining the language in Backus Naur form resulted in nothing but a tiny program supposed to list all prime numbers between 0 and 1000\u2014 constituting some 20 lines of code\u2014finally executing after four months of numerous revisions, each submitted one week apart in hastily corrected punch card stacks. This situation changed radically, when Prof. Peter Reichertz started his work at the Hannover Medical school (MHH) as the Director of very likely the world\u2019s first Division of Medical Informatics in 1969. Having just returned from several responsible positions in the USA \u2013 a last one at the University of Missouri in Columbia\u2014he had assembled a group of, three disciples initially, myself among them. Peter started by giving us his kind of instructions in programming. He gave us real world medical examples to tackle, like a register of patients, their characteristics, appointments, etc. And he used interactive terminals and made sure that turnaround was quick and progress speedy. All of a sudden, a new vision materialized. Maybe here was a way to make a positive health impact on a broad scale! I resigned from my appointment at the Department of Internal Medicine and joined Peter Reichertz in his \u201cAbteilung Medizinische Informatik\u201d which already had stationery in English with \u201cDivision of Medical Informatics\u201d in its letterhead. Immediately after joining Peter, and even before his tiny group of disciples and staff moved into their new premises in the very imposing new Hannover Medical School, I was blessed with the opportunity for an extended tour of many American hot spots of the new discipline\u2014which in the USA was not yet called Medical Informatics. This tour acquainted me with numerous leaders in our field and their work and accomplishments. I will never forget the gracious welcome that I was accorded by such giants in our field as Larry Weed, Warner Slack, Octo Barnett, Bob Greenes, Carlos Valbona, Homer Warner, and Morris Collen. Returning with a sizeable stack of reprints, I continued with delighted enthusiasm in the team of Peter Reichertz, which by now had grown to some 20 academics and staff and operated an IBM 360/67 which filled the equivalent of a dance hall. This monster computer soon grew into a central computing facility of the Medical School supporting administrative and medical functions, integrating data provided by several computers in electrophysiology and imaging labs, and supporting numerous researchers working on their own projects in many departments. My administrative duties included the operation of a central medical record archive, in which all medical records generated in the patient care facilities of MHH were recorded on microfilm and stored in integrated fashion using a unique patient identifier. Copies of the records could then be made available simultaneously to several patient care facilities and as many legitimate researchers as needed them. Inspired by the work of Warner V. Slack I also had begun to work on \u201cComputer Assisted Medical History\u201d, the project for my \u201cHabilitation\u201d in Medical Informatics. This work forced me into an analysis of the nature of medical information, which led to  the insight that the abstract concepts underlying medical information require fundamentally different data handling approaches than, e.g., the data characterizing a stock inventory. This insight, in turn convinced me that proficiency in medical informatics required different training and education than, e.g., commercial computing. From the start, Peter Reichertz had always promoted initiatives in education in Medical Informatics. Serving as his secretary in many of these initiatives, conferences, etc., it was my job to draft minutes and communications. Thus, I had ample opportunity to hone my ideas about education in our field. In fact, Peter had started to offer courses to computer science students at the Technical University of Braunschweig in 1975, and I was invited to offer one course on \u201cMedical Methodology\u201d in which I expanded on the insights gained during the work on my habilitation. Another inspiration arose from the collaboration with Dr. med. Klaus Dieter Haehn, a general practitioner, who at Hannover Medical School eventually became the first professor holding a Chair for General Medicine in Germany. With him and several of his practitioner colleagues, we were able to analyze the structure and function of general practices in Germany. At that time much effort had been poured into devising computer-based diagnostic helps for general practitioners, in an effort to bridge the \u201chiatus scientificus\u201d which allegedly separated general practice from academic medicine, i.e., medicine as it should be. To our surprise, we found that diagnostic support was probably the last thing general practitioners needed. Instead, they needed administrative support. Hence that was an approach which we were eventually able to test through a \u201cField Test of Computers\u201d in doctors\u2019 offices. This experience revealed surprises: contrary to our expectations, sloppily organized practices appreciated and benefited most from computer support, whereas practices which had invested a lot into smoothly functioning organizational procedures resented and hence rejected the computer. In 1976, my \u201cHabilitation\u201d completed, I immediately received an offer to join the University of Heidelberg, which together with the \u201cFachhochschule Heilbronn\u201d (now \u201cHeilbronn University of Applied Sciences\u201d) was offering a curriculum in Medical informatics. This had been started in 1972, and had just graduated its first cohort of students, among them no other than Reinhold Haux. This program had a faculty of ten professors, including mathematicians, computer scientists, statisticians, engineers and an economist, and was therefore well rounded, providing a fertile basis to rounding it out with insights from Hannover-style Medical Informatics. I delighted at the opportunity to expand my course \u201cMedical Methodoloy\u201d and augment the curriculum by an intense one term practical course\u2014without other competing educational offerings\u2014in which students were able to concentrate on analyzing the needs of medical environments by interacting with stakeholders to identify problems, proposing solutions and presenting everything orally and in writing for discussion with the collaborating stakeholders. Collaborating institutions included among other hospital services, medical laboratories, pharmacies, etc. Not quite ten years into this, I received an offer by the University of Victoria to join their \u201cSchool of Health Information Science\u201d inaugurated in 1982 and directed by Professor Denis Protti. I accepted this offer for the following reasons: \u2022 The exquisite leadership provided by Denis Protti; \u2022 Having a son, who is profoundly hard of hearing, and was then 16, I hoped he would pick up a second language and become more proficient in it than in his original German (a hope which materialized);  \u2022 The policy of German universities does not promote scholars within the university. While I fully endorse this principle, it got me into a dead-end street as the Heidelberg Heilbronn curriculum was then the only game of its kind in the country; \u2022 The hope that my marriage, which had reached a brittle state might be salvaged by a new beginning (a hope, which did not materialize). So, in 1986, the year of the fifth Medinfo conference in Washington, D.C., I joined the University of Victoria and not only contributed to the curriculum there much of what I had learned and developed in Germany, but soon engaged with Denis Protti in the organization of a conference on \u201cEducation and Medical Informatics\u201d at the University of Victoria. This conference united some 200 colleagues from many parts of the world in 1989. While at the time there were many endeavors dedicated to introducing computer science to medicine or vice versa, dedicated programs for education in Medical Informatics were still an exception. However, the new environment, its research culture and research funding approaches, also required adjustments. It took until 1995, before some smaller research projects resulted in my becoming part of a \u201cNetwork of Centres of Excellence\u201d called \u201cHEALNET\u201d (Health Evidence and Application Network) which pursued the promotion of evidence-based approaches in health care. This network, funded until 2002, was led by Prof. George Browman, then at MacMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, and resulted in an intense collaboration of investigators at numerous universities across Canada. When this endeavor wound up, I was asked to take over the evaluation of the \u201cBritish Columbia Telehealth Program\u201d, which again was part of a Pan-Canadian research and development initiative aimed at promoting telehealth, the provision of health care by practitioners separated by space. Just as the previous field tests, this one did not lack in surprising results: a dramatic approach by academic surgeons to guide distant colleagues in the handling of emergency situations, was completely rejected by the practitioners as well as patients receiving the \u201chelp\u201d, whereas a modest approach to provide guidance, education and training in pediatric medicine was enthusiastically taken up. With this project completed, I got ready for retirement, but was met with yet another big surprise: Denis and his wife Pat Protti, together with my wife Chris Anglin and the never-failing help of Dr. Felicia Pantazi, the wife of my graduate student Dr. Stefan Pantazi had clandestinely organized a \u201cSurprise Colloquium\u201d attended by some eighty of my most esteemed colleagues and friends from around the world. I was overwhelmed! I would never have believed that my humble contributions deserved so much and such impressive attention. With this finale, and after having served on numerous national and international committees, having organized numerous conferences, graduated a quantity of PhD and Master students, many of whom today fill important positions in Medical Informatics in various countries, I formally retired from university duties in 2005, grateful to my many esteemed and inspiring colleagues and friends, with whom I remain in communication and who had provided me with an exciting and highly rewarding career. ", "Mark Musen": "Professor of Biomedical Informatics & Biomedical Data Science Director, Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Stanford Univ. Donald A. B. Lindberg Award for Innovation in Informatics (2006) Founding Co-Editor-in-Chief of the journal Applied Ontology I owe my entry into the field of medical informatics to dentistry. When I was in eighth grade, my father\u2014then a dentist in Providence, Rhode Island\u2014was drilling on his patient, Bill Shipp, a new assistant professor at Brown University. While bearing down through his enamel, my father asked his patient if he would take his young son into his biology laboratory for a summer internship. Shipp was hardly in a position to say \u201cno.\u201d M. Musen, MD, PhD, NAM, FACMI I worked in Bill\u2019s laboratory that summer and nearly every summer in high school and college\u2014first simply pouring agar plates, but eventually learning something about oxidative phosphorylation and the use of spectrophotometry to study respiratory enzymes in bacteria. My world changed around 1970, when Bill bought a Wang 700 programmable calculator to control the spectrophotometer, to acquire optical-density signals, and to analyze all the data. Suddenly I was asked to program the calculator to perform biological experiments. Using an arcane machine language, I could get the Wang 700 to advance a stepping motor to select a wavelength of light, to cause an analog- to- digital converter to read in a signal, and to process the data in a variety of ways. I began to see that computers could play an essential role in the acquisition and analysis of biomedical data, and I knew that I wanted a career somewhere at or near that intersection. But I wasn\u2019t sure how to get there. I went to college at Brown. Jim Cimino and Chris Chute were also in my class. The three of us were fixated on that intersection of computer science and biomedicine, and none of us at the time knew quite how to achieve our goals. While I was in college, Bill upgraded his Wang calculator to a Sperry-Univac V77 minicomputer. I wrote thousands of lines of assembly code for that machine, developing a text editor and, eventually, a system that enabled users to timeshare the V77 interactively from distributed terminals. This was my first experience implementing systems software, and it made me realize how much I enjoy building infrastructure to help other people do their work\u2014a theme that would recur later in my career. I still was attracted to clinical medicine, and I attended medical school at Brown, where I pursued a very standard medical curriculum. The only computer in sight was an analog computer that we used to solve problems in acid\u2013base balance during my first- year physiology class. Sometime in my junior year, however, I stumbled on a flier for a medical student clerkship at the National Institutes of Health, in what was then the Division of Computer Research and Technology. Bill Mohler was going to lead a six- week course in \u201cComputers in Clinical Medicine\u201d on the Bethesda campus. I was stunned. It was hard for me to believe that such a course even existed. Of course, I applied immediately. I arrived at NIH in the fall of 1979 with six other medical students from around the country. We learned about the exciting plans to install the Technicon Data System at the  NIH Clinical Center to manage patient information; about the deployment of Larry Weed\u2019s PROMIS system at Johns Hopkins University; about the command-line interface that librarians were using to perform assisted Medline searches using MeSH terms. It was affirming and gratifying to see that lots of other people were thinking about computational problems in biomedicine, and that there indeed was a career path that would allow me to bring together my various interests. I began to believe that \u201ccomputers in medicine\u201d could be a credible scientific discipline after all. While I was at the NIH, a new hot-shot scientist at the National Library of Medicine, Marty Epstein, encouraged me to consider Stanford for my medical residency. Marty opened my eyes to Stanford as a focal point for work in medical artificial intelligence. He told me to go to Stanford and to speak with Ted Shortliffe. Marty reassured me that Ted was \u201cremarkably approachable.\u201d (Marty\u2019s assessment was indeed correct.) Ted sold me on Stanford, and I pursued my medical residency there. My residency ended just as the graduate program in Medical Information Science that Ted had initiated was taking in its first group of students. Suddenly, I was engaged in medical informatics full time, and I was beginning to see concretely how I could develop an academic career in this area. Shortly after I began graduate school, Ted and I were walking through Stanford University Hospital. Ted turned to me and lamented the arduous problem of building knowledge bases in LISP for ONCOCIN, the cancer chemotherapy advisor that was then the centerpiece of Ted\u2019s research program. We began to brainstorm ways to ease the knowledge-entry problem. Later, Larry Fagan suggested that we might be able to construct a knowledge-entry user interface in terms more familiar to clinicians, and soon a domain-specific knowledge-acquisition system known as OPAL was born. With help from Joan Differding and Christopher Lane, we built a knowledge-entry system that reproduced the visual metaphors in the printed documents used to specify cancer- chemotherapy protocols\u2014forms and graphical conventions that had obvious meaning to practicing oncologists. Researchers on the ONCOCIN project deemed OPAL a great success, as it met its goal of accelerating the knowledge-entry process for ONCOCIN by enabling clinical investigators to specify chemotherapy protocols quickly and precisely. The downside was that it had taken the team two years to build OPAL, and it was not practical to imagine engineering such a system for every new knowledge-intensive problem that one might want to automate. I decided that my Ph.D. project would be to build a \u201cmeta-OPAL,\u201d an editor for the kind of domain model that drove the OPAL system. The goal was to enable a developer to edit a model of the relevant application area and thereby to generate automatically knowledge-entry systems like OPAL, which then could be used by application experts to specify the domain knowledge needed for advice systems like ONCOCIN. I called the system Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, trying to capture the notion of clinical protocol coupled with some element of learning. After a wonderful post-doc year at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, working closely with Johan van der Lei and Jan van Bemmel, I was back at Stanford as a faculty member. I struggled for a while, trying to make Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 more powerful by enhancing the kinds of domain models that the system might be used to edit and by linking those models directly to different types of problem solvers. That approach turned out to be dead end. It became apparent that the secret to expanding the scope of Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 lay not in making it more complicated, but in making it simpler. Around this time, in the early 1990s, the DARPA Knowledge Sharing Effort was beginning to articulate the notion that computer scientists could use ontologies to  represent an important, reusable aspect of domain knowledge. I jumped on this idea, and I worked with Samson Tu and others on my team to construct a version of the Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 system that would capture static domain knowledge, not as subclasses of a complex model, but as ontologies in a basic, uniform knowledge-representation language. This new approach was key to building a decision-support system for the management of patients who had AIDS or HIV infection that was known as T-HELPER. Later, in collaboration with Mary Goldstein, my team built ATHENA-CDS, a clinical decision support (CDS) system that is still in use at the Veterans Administration Palo Alto Health Care System to help clinicians manage patients who may have a variety of chronic diseases. Construction of the ATHENA-CDS knowledge bases\u2014and their routine maintenance by physicians who have few programming skills\u2014has been possible only because of the OPAL-like, application-specific knowledge-entry tools that Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 can provide. Although my team built Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to aid our own work developing clinical decision- support systems for guideline-based care and for other application areas, it was impossible for us to keep Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in-house. In 1995, I had some beers with three colleagues at a conference in Pavia, Italy, where we declared our gathering, tongue in cheek, the first meeting of the International Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Users Group. By 2000, however, there was a real Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 users group, and Alan Rector hosted a meeting for more than 100 such users at the University of Manchester. Now there are more than 300,000 registered users who have downloaded the Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 software, and Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 remains the most commonly used technology for editing ontologies in the world. My team has used Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to build a host of intelligent systems, to investigate methods for mapping terms between ontologies, and to study issues in large-scale ontology engineering. I am most satisfied, however, that Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 has become an essential part of the informatics infrastructure. I find it enormously rewarding that the research has led to a widely embraced technology that helps other people to do their work. My research has followed a clear progression over the years. The Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 project allowed my group to focus on the challenges of ontology engineering. We then created the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) to study problems in ontology dissemination. To this day, the NCBO BioPortal resource continues to provide access to essentially all the publicly available biomedical ontologies in the world\u2014enabling tens of thousands of users each month to view those ontologies via their Web browsers or to interact with the ontologies programmatically over the Internet. Most recently, my team has founded the Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval (CEDAR), which is investigating how ontologies can be used to annotate publicly available datasets in more comprehensive ways with standardized metadata\u2014facilitating open science and the ability to find and reuse online data more effectively. I discovered the discipline of biomedical informatics quite by chance, on that flier advertising Bill Mohler\u2019s course at the NIH. I turned to research in the area of biomedical ontology simply to advance my own interests in building CDS systems in what seemed to be the most scalable way possible. Along the way, I have come to appreciate both the degree to which semantic technology is fundamental to all work in informatics and the central importance of computational infrastructure in our discipline. I have learned that there is great pleasure not only in making foundational contributions to science, but also in observing the multiplicative effect that occurs when other investigators can use your technology in ways that you never could have imagined.

Newbold": "Consultant in Healthcare Informatics Vice-Chair IMIA Nursing Informatics SIG Co-Chair, AMIA Nursing Informatics History WG Fellow American Academy of Nursing and HIMSS In 1981, I had my first nursing management position as a Head Nurse at a hospital in Laurel, MD., USA. I decided to return to school for my master\u2019s degree in nursing with a goal of returning to direct patient care. At the University of Maryland in Baltimore, I volunteered for a group project on S.K. Newbold, PhD, RN- BC, FAAN, FHIMSS, FAMIA \u201cComputers in Nursing\u201d\u2014a new concept. At the same time, I was working as a Nursing Supervisor at St. Agnes Hospital, Baltimore, MD., which coincidentally was implementing the IBM Patient Care System. I became known to the director of \u201cData Processing\u201d as I was running around the hospital taking pictures of anything that looked like a computer for my school presentation. I began my first informatics job as the Patient Care System Coordinator although I was usually called the \u201cComputer Nurse.\u201d When I gave my presentation at school, the outline was created using the first IBM personal computer and printed out on a dot matrix printer. I never returned to direct patient care and never regretted my decision as I realized I had more impact on patient care and care-givers then in my previous nursing roles. There were two other hospitals in the area\u2014in Virginia and Washington, D.C.\u2014that were also implementing the same IBM system. The coordinators\u2014Susan McDermott, P.J. Hallberg and I\u2014would meet at the Symposium for Computer Applications in Medical Care (SCAMC) and consult with each other in between the yearly conference held in Washington, D.C. In 1982 we formed The Nursing Medical Information System (MIS) Roundtable which later became the Capital Area Roundtable on Informatics in NursinG (CARING). Now CARING is known as the American Nursing Informatics Association (ANIA) and is still going strong as a US-based national nursing informatics group. SCAMC, where ANIA was conceived, is now the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA). AMIA is the United States representative to the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA). While in Baltimore in 1983, I conducted the first hospital workshop in the U.S. entitled Computers in Nursing Practice. Speakers included keynote, Dr. Virginia Saba, whom I consider to be one of the two mothers of nursing informatics, and another Nursing Informatics Pioneer, Linda Edmunds. Since the early days I have worked for vendors in the U.S. and Australia, consultants, universities and now have an educational consulting business based in Franklin, Tennessee. My PhD in Nursing Informatics was conferred by the University of Maryland. I have been certified in Nursing Informatics since 1996. I created an award-winning nursing informatics course in 1995 and now conduct it as the Nursing Informatics Boot Camp. Over time, I co-edited five books and have written numerous articles and book chapters on healthcare informatics topics. I was privileged to be a keynote speaker in the first nursing informatics conferences held in Taiwan and Singapore and have consulted in informatics in the US, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Qatar, Singapore, Slovenia and Taiwan.  At the international level, I served as the AMIA Nursing Informatics Working Group (NI-WG) Representative to the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Nursing Special Interest Group (NI SIG) and also the IMIA NI SIG Vice President Communications. The Maryland Nurses Association awarded me an Outstanding Nurse Educator of the Year, Vanderbilt University School of Nursing, Nashville, TN. awarded an Excellence in Teaching Award and I received a HIT Men-HIT Women award for improving patient care through health information technology. Through HIMSS I won the coveted Chapter leader of the Year award in 2016. I am a Fellow in the American Academy of Nursing, HIMSS, and AMIA. Through AMIA, I was selected as a Pioneer in Nursing Informatics and Co-Chair the task force to preserve the history of Nursing Informatics. I would like to be known for mentoring and educating nurses at all levels in informatics ultimately resulting in improved patient care. Nursing Management, 2003; 34:22-23, 32 ", "Lucila Ohno-Machado": "Professor of Medicine Chair, University of California San Diego Department of Biomedical Informatics Associate Dean for Informatics and Technology My journey into biomedical informatics started during high school in Brazil when I programed HP calculators. Skip ahead a few years to my medical school internship when I read a few articles about artificial intelligence, including descriptions of MYCIN and rule-based decision support systems. By the end of my internship, I was convinced that I needed to pursue a career that combined computer science and medicine. To do this, I completed and helped design the inaugural residency program in medical informatics at the University of Sao Paulo (USP). I later completed an MBA with a focus on healthcare systems, but I still wanted to dive deeper into computer science. I enrolled in the computer science program at USP while applying to medical informatics doctoral programs in North America, Europe, and Asia. After a brief MBA exchange program in Koln, Germany, I was excited to be accepted to the Stanford Medical Information Sciences program led by Ted Shortliffe and moved with my husband to Palo Alto. At Stanford, my interests expanded to machine learning and I sought out mentors in both medical informatics (Mark Musen) and machine learning (David Rumelhart). For my dissertation, titled \u201cConnectionist Models of Survival,\u201d I proposed hierarchical neural network models for survival analysis. Back then it was difficult to find data, particularly labeled data, to train machine learning models\u2014a problem that has been mitigated, though not solved to date, and is still an area of high, personal interest. Fortunately, the data repository at the University of California (UC), Irvine had some medically related data sets, which I used extensively, together with data from the Framingham study. Upon graduating from Stanford, and with a newborn son and husband in tow, my family of three moved to Boston where I spent the next 13 years\u2014first as an instructor at Harvard Medical School (Decision Systems Group, led by Bob Greenes, at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital \u2013 BWH), later as faculty at BWH and at the Health Sciences and Technology (HST) Division of Harvard-MIT, and finally as the endowed chair in medical informatics for directing the Decision Systems Group as well as the NIH-funded T15 Boston Informatics Research Training Program, a consortium that included Harvard, MIT, Tufts, and Boston University. During my time in Boston, my family grew with two more sons. My sons were raised in a typical New England suburb where we made life-long friends and enjoyed long winters sitting together near our fireplace as well as short summers at the beach in Cape Cod. We continued to be connected to our friends from Brazil. During this time, I learned to understand and embrace diversity that is not only related to race, ethnicity, and national origin, but also related to disability and socio-economic status. At work, the importance of data to drive healthcare decisions continued to grow, as did my intent to make a difference in people\u2019s lives through health informatics advances. It seemed incredible to me that, while we could develop sophisticated algorithms to build and  evaluate predictive models, the availability of data on a large scale was still a big barrier to data-driven healthcare. I grew even more interested in using real healthcare data to help decision making because of health events involving family, friends, and co-workers. Enabling data sharing for research, while preserving patient privacy, became one of my main research goals. My research focused on medical applications of machine learning, with particular emphasis on calibration of predictive models. I also worked on a language to represent clinical guidelines (Guideline Interchange Format \u2013 GLIF), and on one of the first systems for remotely monitoring patient vital signs (Scalable Medical Alert Response Technology \u2013 SMART). These projects were featured in my first articles in JAMIA. On the education-side, I co-developed the curriculum for HST\u2019s master\u2019s degree together with Peter Szolovits and organized a seminar series for the NLM-funded training program, together with my colleagues, Shawn Murphy and Hamish Fraser. While my research and family life were becoming settled on the East Coast, a transition back to the West Coast was about to happen. In the middle of one summer afternoon in Boston in 2008, I received a call from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD): the university was searching for an inaugural chief of its division of biomedical informatics, which would be the first academic unit in the field of biomedical informatics in the entire UC system. I jumped at this opportunity and moved to UCSD one year later to build a brand-new division together with four colleagues from Boston. Hyeon-eui Kim, one of our division\u2019s founding faculty members who moved with me, was the first nurse to be appointed to the UCSD Department of Medicine faculty. In subsequent years, the division has recruited over 100 personnel (staff, faculty, including Chris Longhurst, a CIO trained in informatics, and trainees), developed and delivered training curricula, and provided internship opportunities for over 80 trainees. I have also remained active in education and continue to collaborate with colleagues in Brazil (primarily Heimar Marin and Sandro de Souza) and Mozambique (Francisco Mabila) in various health informatics educational programs. I was excited to pioneer the development of a division of biomedical informatics at UCSD and champion one of my main research goals\u2014privacy-preserving data sharing for research. Then in 2015, I was proud to evolve it into a UC Health Department. This was the chance to bring data to the forefront of healthcare decision-making. I shaped our department\u2019s vision to integrate clinical informatics research and applications into the UCSD health system, while continuing research in informatics foundations and building a training program covering a broad spectrum of training levels. Our department also serves UCSD\u2019s CTSA, in which we have been fully participating, from the first funded proposal to the most recent renewal. Our department and the Clinical and Translational Research Institute co-recruited UCSD\u2019s first Clinical Research Information Officer, Mike Hogarth, to ensure our missions stay closely aligned. Simultaneously, biomedical informatics has grown in the entire UC system with a focus on multiple aspects of data sharing: from facilitating data harmonization in large area networks, to protecting the privacy of individuals whose data would be shared, to ensuring that data sets are findable and reusable. With colleagues from the other UC campuses, we have created UC-ReX (Research eXchange), the first federated clinical data warehouse covering all UC medical centers. This work later extended to developing the PCORI-funded pSCANNER (patient-centered SCAlable National Network for Effectiveness Research), which includes the national VA enterprise data warehouse as well as other health systems. The National Center for Biomedical Computing iDASH (integrating Data for Analysis, \u2018anonymization,\u2019 and SHaring), and the Big Data to  Knowledge biomedical and healthCAre Data Discovery Index Ecosystem (bioCADDIE) are large NIH-funded consortium projects that put many of our research products into practice and helped us establish the California Precision Medicine Consortium for the SM All of Us Research Program. pSCANNER, iDASH, and bioCADDIE have all been featured in JAMIA, together with peer-funded projects from within these respective large programs. JAMIA has been one of the highlights of my professional career. I remember seeing the first issue in 1994, while I was still a graduate student at Stanford. I have since served as a reviewer, editorial member, and associate editor for JAMIA. In 2010, through a national search, I was selected to serve a four-year term as editor-in-chief, which was later renewed for an additional four years. I am proud of what JAMIA has accomplished during my time as editor-in-chief: the journal has more than doubled its number of submissions and published articles, developed a journal club that is viewed by informaticians worldwide, instituted a voting process to elect new editorial board and associate editor members, and maintained its reputation as the premier venue for dissemination of biomedical informatics scholarly work. I worked directly with journal production personnel and prominent biomedical informatics professionals who served as associate editors, and indirectly with many editorial board members, reviewers, and readers. I had the opportunity to see those who, like myself, start as reviewers, advance to editorial board members and associate editors, and I predict they will likely become future editors of JAMIA. The volume and nature of decision making I experienced as editor-in-chief prepared me for other leadership roles, which I embraced along the way. As department chair and associate dean for informatics and technology at UCSD\u2019s School of Medicine, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to put together teams to work on different fronts of UCSD\u2019s tri-partite mission of teaching, research, and service. It has been very satisfying to see how UCSD, one of the most reputable academic institutions in the world, now recognizes biomedical informatics as an integral part of its academic medical center. Informatics has become known in the UC system as a must- have specialty, leading to recruitment of several informatics professionals at UCSD and the other UC campuses. My long journey from a high schooler in Brazil interested in programming to celebrating 10 years of developing a new academic unit at UCSD has been rewarding and exciting. Even more so is seeing how my former colleagues and trainees are now recognized as informatics leaders at various institutions across the globe. ", "Gilbert S. Omenn": "Professor of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics, Internal Medicine, Human Genetics, and Public Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI I have long been a user of informatics and databases for my research on proteins, neurogenetics, cancer chemoprevention trials, and environmental risk assessment. I invested in data generation and analytics as Dean of the School of Public Health & Community Medicine at the University of Washington (1982-97) and then as CEO of the University of Michigan Health System (1997-2002). In 2001 we launched the UM PhD Program in Bioinformatics, led by David States, which has now graduated 62 well-placed PhDs. I was appointed in 2005 to establish and direct a university-wide Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics. Brian Athey joined as my deputy; he became my department chair when we established a new Medical School Department of the same title 7 years later; I continue as director of the University-wide Center. We and our colleagues competed for one of the new NIH National Centers for Biomedical Computing in 2007, which we called the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics. Integration is a powerful concept and biomedical informatics is an essential capability for the modern world of omics platforms and personalized or precision medicine. It was the regular meetings of the National Centers for Biomedical Computing that brought me into regular contact with AMIA members across the country. I participated extensively in the first few Translational Bioinformatics Summit meetings held each spring in San Francisco as well as the AMIA November meeting in DC. I was proud to be elected to the American College of Medical Informatics in 2009 and have brought my scientific interests and health policy and science policy experience to the winter meetings of the ACMI Fellows. Since 2002 I have been in the leadership of the global Human Proteome Organization (HUPO). Bioinformatics and medical informatics are at the heart of the HUPO Human Proteome Project (HPP). The HPP was initiated in 2011 on the foundation of several initiatives initiated starting in 2002 focused on plasma, liver, brain, heart, diabetes, and protein standards (www.hupo.org). The goals of the HPP are (1) to make proteomics a full complement to genomics in the broad domains of life sciences and biomedical research; and (2) to progressively complete the human protein parts list with at least one protein product from each protein-coding gene, as well as sequence variants, splice isoforms, and post-translational modifications. The HPP has research teams for each of the 24 chromosomes and 22 biology or disease-driven themes, plus resource pillars for mass spectrometry, antibody profiling, and bioinformatics. neXtProt in Geneva, Switzerland, is the gold standard curated database for protein findings; PeptideAtlas in Seattle and Global Proteome Machine (GPMdb) in Canada independently reanalyze all mass spectrometry results from the raw data and metadata using standardized pipelines; the Human Protein Atlas in Stockholm has immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence results and now transcript findings for  dozens of tissue and cell types. All of these resources are linked through the ProteomeXchange we created at the European Bioinformatics Institute in Cambridge UK, facilitating data sharing and quality enhancement. The HPP issued guidelines in 2012 and upgraded them in 2016 to improve data quality and overcome a high propensity in mass spectrometry and, more broadly, in proteogenomics for false-positive identifications. We have carefully documented the annual progress of the HPP, with 87% of the 19,467 predicted protein-coding genes now having high-confidence evidence of expression of proteins. My personal research in the past decade has focused on alternative splicing of the RNA transcripts from protein-coding genes to make the messenger RNAs. Splicing is a remarkable evolutionary development in multi-cellular organisms with multi-exon gene structures. Once thought to be quite unusual, splicing is now recognized in nearly all genes, with an average of about five mRNA and protein products per gene. Thus, the thousands of articles published each month still describing up or down regulation of \u201cgenes\u201d are casually referring to these mixtures of products, whereas the individual isoforms can and often do have quite different functions reflecting their altered sequences. As two examples, one splice isoform is pro-apoptotic, while another from the same gene is anti-apoptotic; another gene has transcriptional activator and transcriptional repressor protein isoforms. The relative proportions of these isoforms reflects a whole new level of regulated homeostasis. We have reported many key proteins with splice isoforms whose differential expression changes significantly between normal and malignant samples of the same organ or between different subtypes of, e.g., ERBB2+ (Her2+) breast cancers versus other types of breast cancers. Originally, we started from mass spectrometry of tryptic digests of tissue specimens or plasma. We created special modified ECgene databases with 10M entries for mouse and 14M entries for humans of all potential three-frame protein sequences to identify novel findings; of course, we also captured splice variants already known in the major reference databases. Then we performed qRT-PCR to demonstrate the presence of the corresponding spliced mRNA. With the emergence of deep sequencing of mRNA, we use the quantitative readout of spliced transcripts to identify the known and novel splice isoforms and then search proteomics results for corresponding translation products. We utilized the I-TASSER family of algorithms for protein folding and functional predictions to compare pairs of splice isoforms of a particular gene and protein of interest. We subsequently utilized machine learning/multiple instance learning methods to predict isoform-level biological networks genome-wide; these resources are available at guanlab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/publications as guides for designing or interpreting experimental studies. I expect such splice proteins to be more specific biomarkers and more specific targets for precision therapies. With the archives of next-generation RNA sequencing results, quantitation of splice transcripts is widely available, so the emphasis can be shifted to bioinformatics analyses and annotations. Our most recent HPP Metrics paper described the availability of extensive information about splice isoforms as well as sequence variants and post-translational modifications in the major proteomics databases. In the past year, as part of the University of Michigan Data Sciences Institute (MIDAS) initiatives, my colleagues and I in Medicine, Mathematics, Engineering, and Public Health have developed a Data Analytics Center for Single-Cell Studies of developmental and neoplastic processes and disorders. The whole University recognizes data sciences and biomedical informatics as growth areas for education, research, and our clinical care system. ", "Paula Otero": "Professor Department of Information in Health Chief of Product Innovation Italian Hospital of Buenos Aires I graduated in 1992 from the School of Medicine of University of Salvador (USAL) and then specialized in Pediatrics at the Hospital Italiano of Buenos Aires (HIBA) in 1997. I completed a MSc as Executive Manager in Hospitals at the Open University of P. Otero, MD, MSc, FIAHSI Catalonia (UOC) in 2014. I currently am Manager of Innovation and New Technologies at the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires. I have worked as part of the initial team in the creation of the Medical Informatics Residency training program at HIBA. I have been active in the development and implementation of \u201cITALICA\u201d which is the Health Information System of Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires. I have also actively participated in the development of several training programs in the region, including a Spanish version of the OHSU version of the 10x10 program. I have been Chair of the IMIA Health and Medical Informatics Education (WG 5) and was elected as Fellow of the initial class of the International Academy of Health Sciences Informatics (IAHSI), for which I currently serve as Secretary of the Board. I am President of the Committee on Health Informatics of the Argentine Pediatric Society (SAP) and serve on the Editorial Board of Archivos Argentinos de Pediatr\u00eda, as well as being on the Editorial team of Applied Clinical Informatics (ACI) and the International Journal of Medical Informatics (IJMI). Throughout these years I have published over 100 papers in peer-reviewed journals, and have collaborated in producing several chapters and books, as well as participating and presenting at more than 150 international conferences. My current appointment is as Professor of Medical Informatics at the Department of Medical Informatics at the Institute University of the Hospital Italiano in Buenos Aires, Argentina and Co-Director of the Master\u2019s Degree Program of Health Informatics launched in 2017. When I started my training as MD I was pretty sure I wanted to pursue a career in Pediatrics, so when I started as a resident at HIBA I not only enjoyed the process of becoming a pediatrician, but also recognized the importance of working at an academic medical center, where not only healthcare was important, but also research and education. When I was in the last years of my residency training in 1997, a new project emerged...the Hospital was going to build in-house a Health Information System, so people from different areas were invited to participate in the project. At that time, I was not sure why I accepted, but I believed that becoming part of the team of a innovative project for the country and the region was a great initiative and I wanted to be part of it. So that was my initial step in working on the field, and now I feel proud when I look on all the work done and the new projects that continue to emerge. ", "Judy Ozbolt": "Professor Emeritus, University of Maryland PhD, RN (ret.), FAAN, FACMI, FAIMBE Founding Board Member, AMIA Past President, ACMI Building a Foundation for Nursing Informatics Science I began my research program in nursing informatics in 1972, while a student in the University of Michigan\u2019s Master of Science specialty in medical-surgical nursing. The inspiration was a lecture by Professor Samuel Schultz II describing computer programs that were being developed to formulate difficult medical diagnoses. Would it be possible, I asked, to develop a computer program that would use data from the nursing assessment to formulate nursing diagnoses? Yes, Professor Schultz responded; a prior student in the program, Suzanne Lagina, had developed a program to diagnose patients\u2019 anxiety levels (Lagina, 1971). With my research partner, fellow student Bernadine Symons Edwards, I undertook the project that would become the foundation of my research career. The literature offered little guidance. There was no consensus that nurses were licensed to make diagnoses of any sort. A \u201cnursing problem\u201d was any problem a nurse might address in professional practice, a definition that could not be more circular or unenlightening. The organization that would evolve into the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA) had not yet convened its first meeting. Bernadine and I had to conceptualize what constituted a nursing diagnosis and then populate that conceptual model with terms. Furthermore, we had to demonstrate the place of diagnosis in the nursing process by creating a model of the process. And we had to determine what assessment data were needed to reach each diagnosis. As the early conceptual and modeling work proceeded, I took a course in programming in Fortran IV and Bernadine acquired the keypunching skills needed to write each line of the program onto an individual paper card. More than a year and 6000 lines of code later, the program ran, and nurses evaluated it. They concluded that the program would probably help them to make better diagnostic decisions, but that it took too long to enter the assessment data and receive the diagnoses (Goodwin and Edwards, 1975) (Prior to 1980, I published as Judy Ozbolt Goodwin). That criticism reflected the technological constraints of the time. Because there were no computer terminals in the patient-care areas of the University of Michigan Medical Center, nurses had to assess the patients, make written notes, and return to the computer laboratory in the School of Nursing to enter the data. Nurses connected with the University of Michigan\u2019s main-frame computer, an IBM 360-67, by dialing a telephone and, when the signal was established, snapping the handset into an acoustic coupler on the side of a printing terminal. (The School of Nursing had no cathode-ray terminals with screens.) Consequently, nurses had to wait while a printer slower than a skilled human typist laboriously presented each question of the assessment and each of the multiple- choice response options. The nurse would type the letter of the selected response, and the process would repeat. It took about an hour to enter the data and receive the diagnoses.  The fundamental questions explored in that master\u2019s research project continued to guide my research. What basic concepts and relationships defined each stage of the nursing process? What decisions were required at each stage, and what data were needed to reach effective decisions? How did the philosophic perspective of nursing (e.g., optimizing functional abilities vs. supporting self-care vs. promoting adaptation) affect the terms applied at each stage? How could the quality and effectiveness of nursing care be defined and measured? How could evolving information technologies help to represent nursing phenomena, support nursing decisions, and document nursing assessments, diagnoses, goals, actions, and outcomes? And finally, what statistical approaches could be applied to precisely defined and measured data stored in electronic records to evaluate the effectiveness and the efficiency of care and thus promote better processes and outcomes? My employment during graduate school on a project to develop measures of patient outcomes that would reflect nursing quality (Clinton, Denyes, Goodwin, & Koto, 1977) gave me knowledge of a variety of methods to define and measure the quality of care. When I moved to France after earning my PhD to teach in that nation\u2019s only master\u2019s program in nursing, I learned that measuring the quality of nursing or medical care was a novel idea in France. I participated in a high-level panel discussion with French nurses, physicians, health care executives, and educators exploring definitions of quality of care and methods of assessment. While in France, I published several articles on the topic in French nursing and medical journals. I returned to the University of Michigan as an associate professor in 1980 and developed several more prototype programs to support nursing decisions. During the 1980\u2019s, I gained opportunities for leadership in promoting computer applications in nursing and medicine. I served on a study section for the National Center for Health Services Research and Technology Assessment (now the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ) and was the first nurse elected to the Board of Directors of the Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care (now subsumed into the American Medical Informatics Association, or AMIA). In 1988 I co-chaired the scientific program committee of an invitational working conference in nursing informatics sponsored by the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA). That work, conducted in Killarney, Ireland, led to publication of a book, Decision Support Systems for Nursing (Ozbolt, Vandewal, & Hannah, 1990), that won a Book of the Year award from the American Nurses Association. Beginning in 1989, I chaired an expert panel for the National Center for Nursing Research (now the National Institute for Nursing Research, or NINR), to identify research priorities in nursing informatics. That report (Ozbolt, 1993) guided funding decisions for nursing informatics research for the next decade. In the 1990\u2019s, then at the University of Virginia as Associate Dean for Research and Director of the PhD program, I served AMIA as a founding member of the Board of Directors, and sequentially as first chair of the nursing informatics working group, Secretary of the Board, and chair of the scientific program committee for the annual symposium (Ozbolt, 1994), as well as serving numerous terms on the Board and its Executive Committee. I was also elected to the American College of Medical Informatics, the honorary society associated with AMIA. During the nineties, I continued to pursue standardized terminologies that would provide valid and reliable clinical data to investigate nursing phenomena and the effectiveness of nursing care (Ozbolt, Russo, & Stultz, 1995; Ozbolt, 1996).  In 1998, I joined the innovative team in biomedical informatics at Vanderbilt University as Independence Foundation Professor of Nursing and Professor of Biomedical Informatics. The Dean of the School of Nursing, Colleen Conway-Welch, charged me with resolving the conflicting camps of clinical nursing terminology so that nursing data could be used for research and quality improvement. With support from the National Library of Medicine and from vendors of electronic health records, I convened all the American developers of nursing terminologies along with interdisciplinary experts in biomedical data, terminologies, and standards to confer about what was required for nursing terminology standards. The first Nursing Terminology Summit in 1999 achieved agreement that a concept-based nursing terminology reference model was required. The 2000 Nursing Terminology Summit brought in experts from Europe, Asia, Australia, and Latin America to join with North Americans in considering how to arrive at an international standard that all could support. Subsequent to the discussions at the Terminology Summit, the nursing informatics group within IMIA established technical and advisory panels, and in 2001, IMIA submitted a reference terminology model to the International Standards Organization (ISO) that was quickly adopted, based on the global support for the model. Other investigators used the Terminology Summits (which continued for 10 years) as a springboard to establish standards for nursing terminology and data in other standards organizations, including the Systematic Nomenclature of Medicine\u2014Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT), the Logical Object Identifiers, Names, and Codes (LOINC), and the Committ\u00e9e Europ\u00e9en de Normalisation (the European Standards Committee) (Ozbolt, 2003). On the strength of these interdisciplinary accomplishments, I was named the 2001-2002 Joe B. Wyatt Distinguished University Professor at Vanderbilt. In 2005, I was elected President of ACMI, also becoming a Scholar at the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies of Science, leading planning on 5-year priorities for NAS-wide studies in biomedical and health informatics. In 2006, I became Professor and Specialty Director for graduate studies in nursing informatics at the University of Maryland. With a grant from the Health Resources and Services Administration, over the next three years I recruited additional faculty members, tripled the enrollment in the master\u2019s specialty in informatics, and increased the diversity of the student body. After my retirement from the University of Maryland in 2010, I chaired a technical expert panel on unintended consequences of electronic health records and meaningful use, commissioned by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. We produced a report \u201cBuilding Better Consumer eHealth,\u201d available at the federal government\u2019s health information technology website. Finally, following staff turnover in the Office of Professional Development and a consequent loss of institutional memory at the University of Maryland School of Nursing, I agreed to return to chairing the annual Summer Institute in Nursing Informatics. I served in that role for several years and relinquished it for full retirement after the 2015 Symposium. I trace the heritage of my research from Florence Nightingale, who decried the lack of \u201chospital records fit for any purpose of comparison\u201d (Nightingale, 1863) and through my mentor Harriet Werley, a champion since the 1950\u2019s of standardized nursing data sets that could be used to evaluate the quality of care and improve patient outcomes. Today, thanks to interdisciplinary and international collaboration, data and terminology standards exist that, when incorporated into electronic health records, enable nurses to conduct research on clinical data \u201c\u2026to save life and suffering and improve the care of the sick\u2026\u201d (Nightingale, 1863). ", "Thomas E. Piemme (1932-2021)": "I received my medical degree at the University of Pittsburgh; I was then trained in internal medicine and cardiology at Pitt and at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston. My interest in computer applications in medicine was sparked by my association with Octo Barnett, when we were residents together at the Brigham in 1960. The following year, Octo opened a new computer laboratory at the Brigham, while I began a fellowship in cardiology with Lewis Dexter. It was a remarkable year for the introduction of electronic devices in cardiac catheter laboratories, enabling new diagnostic techniques. I began taking courses in computer science and medical instrumentation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, becoming knowledgeable about the physics of physiologic pressure transducers. Among devices developed, was a miniaturized variable inductance transducer, placed on the tip of a catheter that enabled instantaneous pressure recording with a frequency response that permitted the simultaneous capture of heart sounds from within the central aorta. At about the same time, there appeared a small flowmeter that could be placed around the ascending aorta of an experimental animal, capturing an instantaneous record of blood flow\u2014the first derivative of which would represent acceleration of flow. With Barnett providing the electronic differentiating device, and ensuring simultaneous recording, we were able to show events of the cardiac cycle with unprecedented fidelity. We demonstrated that heart sounds are generated, not by valves per se, but by force generated by acceleration and deceleration of blood flow, and the impedance provided by valves and the cardiac wall. As Chief Resident in Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh a year later, I was able to obtain Homer Warner\u2019s classic program for the diagnosis of congenital heart disease. I abstracted information from 10 pediatric surgery patients at Children\u2019s Hospital, and presented the data to cohorts of residents, practicing internists, cardiologists, and surgeons. Only two of the respondents provided diagnoses that equaled the accuracy of the computer program: the chief of thoracic surgery, and the chief resident in surgery. I presented the study at medical grand rounds. Jack Myers, chair of medicine at the time, made a decision to abort the presentation of the customary second case, and, instead, presided over a lengthy discussion of the potential role of the computer in medical diagnosis. In the years to come, he was to devote his remaining academic career to the issue. When I joined the faculty at Pittsburgh in 1966, it had been my intent to continue work in computer applications in cardiovascular research. My interest, however, was redirected to issues in health services research and delivery. It was to be more than a decade before I turned back to computer science. In 1970, I moved to the George Washington University where I founded the Department of Health Care Sciences, responsible for patient care and education in primary care settings. Among other  initiatives, we established a physician assistant training program, a university-based health maintenance organization, and a primary care internal medicine residency program. In 1979 I became Director of Continuing Medical Education. Shortly after opening an office, I was visited by Helmuth Orthner who asked for assistance in managing the Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care. This annual meeting had been conducted twice by a consortium of Washington-based organizations which had limited resources. Having attended both meetings, I was persuaded that the meeting had enormous potential for a far wider national audience. I was authorized to advance the necessary capital for a substantial marketing effort, and invested $40,000 ($120,000, when adjusted for inflation) into mass mailing of an \u201cAdvance Program.\u201d The result was a tripling of prior registration, and substantive participation in an industry exhibit. At my suggestion, the Board of Directors incorporated \u201cSCAMC,\u201d now a self-sustaining enterprise. I became the Executive Director, and managed the meeting through my office, under contract, for the next 12 years. Participation grew to 2500 registrants and more than 100 exhibitors. The Proceedings of the meeting became recognized as the prime resource for publications in computer-related health-science research activities in the nation. In 1983, at a SCAMC meeting in Baltimore, five persons (Morris Collen, Scott Blois, Don Lindberg, Ted Shortliffe, and I) met to discuss the formation of an American College of Medical Informatics. During a long afternoon, we concluded that it was realistic, and designed a strategy to elect 50 leaders in informatics from a list of 100 candidates whom we identified. My office was to implement the strategy. Over the next several months, 53 persons (including tied votes) were elected by the hundred nominees. Bylaws were crafted, and an inaugural meeting planned for May of 1974 in San Francisco. At that meeting, I was elected Secretary, and continued to manage the organization as a de facto executive until 1990. In 1983 I had been asked by the Association of Academic Health Centers to produce a monograph on the management of computer resources within academic health centers throughout the country. Working with Marion Ball the document was completed and published by the AAHC in 1984 (Executive Management of Computer Resources in the Academic Health Center). Responding to high demand, the monograph went through several printings over the next few years. Meanwhile, my personal interest was computer assisted education and evaluation of medical students and residents. I was asked by the National Board of Medical Examiners in 1984 to become Chair of a new Computer Based Examination Test Committee, charged with developing interactive simulations of patient encounters. A separate committee was charged with the responsibility for developing algorithms for scoring the candidate responses. The simulations were field tested as part of the third year curriculum at the George Washington University and elsewhere. Controversy arose over some of the response priorities used by the scoring committee. My role then shifted. While others continued to develop the simulations, I chaired a small committee to scan printouts of the student interactions with the simulations in order to refine the algorithms \u2013 work that went on for more than eight years. After a long gestation, during which these scoring issues were resolved, the examination became part of the licensing sequence of examinations by the NBME and the Federation of State Medical Boards. In 1988, I published a review of the state of the art in the use of computers in education and testing (\u201cComputer-Assisted Learning and Evaluation in Medicine.\u201d JAMA 1988;260:367-372).  By 1989 it had become clear that the three leading biomedical computing organizations in the United States, the American Association for Medical Systems and Informatics, SCAMC, and the College = each serving a different purpose \u2013 were complementary. They met together in the fall of each year; increasingly they shared the same leadership. A consensus developed that they be merged. Ted Shortliffe and I began crafting bylaws for a new organization to be called the American Medical Informatics Association. The union occurred in November 1990. The combined resources were such that this new entity could function autonomously with its own executive staff, and the formal contractual relationships among SCAMC, the College, and the George Washington University ended. In 1990, I succeeded Bill Yamamoto as Chair of the Department of Computer Medicine at the George Washington University. My work with the National Board of Medical Examiners continued until my retirement in 1998. My association with the International Medical Informatics Association began in the early 80s. Washington DC had been selected as the locus for MEDINFO 86. Given its experience with the conduct of large informatics conferences and exhibits, SCAMC was charged by the Organizing Committee, under the leadership of Don Lindberg, with handling the logistics of the meeting as executive director, I became, effectively, the meeting manager. In 1988, I was appointed the alternate to Marion Ball as the U.S. Representative to IMIA. Among other activities with IMIA, I was asked to be a co-editor of the Proceedings for MEDINFO 1992 in Geneva, Switzerland. I continued my involvement until my retirement. JAMA, 1988; 260:367-372 ", "Denis Protti": "Professor Emeritus, University of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada Reflections on my ~50 years in the use of computer technology in medicine and health care \u2013 long before it was called Medical/Health Informatics I am so old that when I graduated from the University of Alberta in 1965 with a BSc. in Mathematics\u2014which included two computer science courses\u2014I was considered an \u201cexpert\u201d! After two years working as a computer programmer for Shell Canada, in April 1967, I found myself in the basement of the Medical School at the University of Manitoba. One of my first tasks was to install an IBM RJE (remote job entry) terminal so that the researchers from the Schools of Medicine and Dentistry could have their punched cards read and the data transmitted to the university computer over the telephone line; the computer printouts would then be sent back to the RJE terminal to be printed. The Medical School was 6 miles away from the main frame computer on the U of M campus in Fort Garry. Dr. Michael Saunders, head of the EEG department at the Winnipeg General Hospital had been chosen to be the Director of the Computer Department of Health Sciences\u2014the first of its kind in Canada; in fact, I don\u2019t think that another one was ever created anywhere else in Canada though they did exist in European medical schools. My first title was Systems Analyst; I became the Director when Dr. Saunders died in 1971. I can vividly recall one day when he told me that we would not see a quantum change in the use of computer technology until we saw a change in the power structure of the medical schools. He was responding to my bemoaning that we were progressing so slowly \u2013 in my opinion. Needless to say, his prophecy came true and for decades later I would quote his saying while giving lectures around the world. These were the very early years of the use of computer technology in medicine and st health care anywhere in the world, but we were one of the 1 non-military sites in North America to transmit digital data over analog telephone lines! Those were also the very early days of telecommunications from computer terminals to mainframe computers. I can also recall that American and later Canadian universities were the first to connect to ARPANET in the early \u201870\u2019s. I can remember when the University of Manitoba was added to the list of approved universities in the late \u201870\u2019s. In 1968, we replaced the Remote Job Entry (RJE) terminal with a CDC 1700, 16-bit minicomputer. This not only provided the RJE capabilities but it also allowed the writing and processing of computer programs without having to send them to the large IBM 360 mainframe on the campus. I vividly remember coming home one night all excited to tell my wife Pat that we had just received approval to double the amount of memory \u2013 from 8K to 16K! My early years at the Medical School were taken up with programming projects with researchers in the medical school and the Winnipeg General Hospital. A blood gas program that I wrote in Fortran ran on a teletype machine that was installed outside the ICU. The ICU was Canada\u2019s first intensive care unit, which for well over a decade stood  as a model for the rest of the country and internationally. One of my first peer reviewed publications (little at the time did I know I would become an academic someday) was with Drs. Naimark and Cherniack published in Methods of Information in Medicine, Vol. 103, No. 2, February 1971. In my later years at CDHS (Computer Department for Health Sciences), my job became much more a management one as we had grown to a staff of 12 people. In 1972, I was lured across the river to work at St. Boniface General Hospital. I took over the small Data Processing department - a name I changed to Computing Services. There was no computer in the hospital as all data processing was carried out at the Manitoba Hospital Association data center. All the applications at the time were financial or administrative. I was committed to start using computer technology in the clinical operations of the hospital. During my 6 years there, I was responsible for program development, design and management of all information systems, both clinical and financial. I was appointed to Medical Staff committees and to the Hospital's Planning Task Force. As a member of the Hospital\u2019s executive committee, I shared \"on call Administrator\" responsibilities. I was appointed the project leader to select a Medical Information System for the province of Manitoba. I also chaired a provincial committee on government information gathering. In the early seventies, aside from the research community, few Canadians in healthcare, or more accurately, in hospitals, looked to data processing as more than a means of computerizing their payrolls, and other routine and high-volume recording tasks. In fact, in an internal hospital environment, even that was frowned upon as being high-risk with no ROI (return on investment). Service bureaus prevailed. As there was virtually no commercially available hospital-based application software, there was a strong focus on hardware and the proprietary operating systems that supported application development. On July 1, 1979, I ventured west to a new job as the Director of Information Systems at the Royal Jubilee Hospital in Victoria, British Columbia. During my tenure at the hospital, I was responsible for developing and integrating the Hospital's information resources including data, text, voice and image. I developed a three-year long-range plan for information systems program development. One of the highlights of my short stay at the RJH was when we needed to replace the computer in the Clinical Laboratory as it was failing more and more often. However, the Ministry of Health had a \u2018freeze\u2019 on \u2013 no new computers. I came up with the idea of packaging a \u2018new\u2019 computer as a modification to the existing one which would not cost the RJH anymore than we were already paying. When the Ministry found out some months later, it was too late. One of the painful memories of my time at the RJH was that I was frequently (often 2-3 times a week) in Vancouver. Soon after arriving, I was appointed to sit and chair many provincial committees. One was to chair a multi hospital & government investigation of Hospital Information Systems for Lions Gate Hospital and another was to chair a Provincial Advisory Committee on Computers. There were not many flights between Victoria and Vancouver in those days hence, there were numerous occasions of having to sit around the Vancouver airport waiting for the next flight to Victoria. My impending and unforeseen transition to the University of Victoria began in the fall of 1980 when I was asked to sit, as a community representative from the RJH, on a selection committee for the head of a new program called \u201cHealth Information Science\u201d. After twice failing to find a suitable candidate, two of the University committee members, invited me to lunch. There they invited me to step off the committee and put my name in  to the hat for the Director\u2019s position. This was completely unexpected and flattering but was not without risk for someone with a wife, three children and a mortgage! The third time around, two other qualified candidates also applied including a physician who also had a degree in Computer Science and was already teaching at University of Victoria. I was fortunately chosen to be the Director of the Program in Health Information Science. I started on July 1, 1981 creating the first academic program in Canada and one of the few in the world at that time. The program was then and remains today unique in Canada though there are now a few smaller programs in Eastern Canada. I spent the first-year planning how a 4-year, Cooperative Education (CO-OP)-based, program would be offered. I wrote letters (email was just starting to be used in those days) seeking advice from the international leaders of our emerging field and discipline \u2013 people such as John Anderson in England, Fran\u00e7ois Gr\u00e9my in France, Peter Riechertz, and Jochen Moehr in Germany, and Don Lindberg, Scotty Pratt, Homer Warner, Otto Barnett and Morris Collen in the US. The major change I made from to the 3-page outline that I inherited was to style the program more about the use of computer technology in the all-encompassing health care field rather than a medically oriented epidemiology-biostatistics program that had been proposed. There were some challenging times convincing the University Senate to accept the new approach. My model had cut out some courses that other university departments wanted me to include as it meant new revenue for them. Others could not understand why I wanted to include a course from the Theatre Department \u2013 a course which would help our students cultivate their presentation and communications skills which I felt then and still do this day as the single most important skill our students need to develop. In the fall of 1982, my initial curriculum was implemented. It was based, in part on the ACM's SIGBIO Group 1979 model curriculum for Ph.D. programs in the field of Health Computing. My original curriculum was also heavily based on the ACM's model curriculum on Management Information Systems; a curriculum which specifically distinguished the field from that of Computer Science. Dr. Jochen Moehr\u2019s Heidelberg/Heilbronn curriculum also influenced the design of the UVic curriculum. I can still see the 6-page letter he wrote to me when I asked for his advice. Our many subsequent discussions both in person and by early uses of e-mail significantly influenced my thinking about what it meant to develop an academic program in the newly emerging field of Health Informatics. It gave me a great deal of comfort 3 years later when he agreed to come and join us in Victoria in 1986. In September 1983, the inaugural class of 17 students was admitted while the economic recession began to affect British Columbia and all of Canada. The program's future was seriously in doubt, to the point that the University's Admissions Office was advising new applicants that the Program was going to be terminated. It was a scary time! The program's team at the time consisted of only me, a part-time co-op coordinator and a secretary along with sessional lecturers. The program survived primarily due to the pressure put on the University from the BC Ministry of Health and members of the health care community and as result we became a School in 1986. Today the School is striving and offers five programs starting with a Bachelor of Science degree as well as a combined Major in Computer Science and Health Information Science. At the graduate level, there is an MSc program with on-campus or online streams and a PhD program. A new double degree: Master of Nursing & Master of Science in Health Information Science was added in 2013. By the end of 2016, over 880 students (730 BSc) had graduated since the first class started in 1982. The number of full-time faculty was seven with five support staff and  several sessional lecturers. As of September 2016, there were 170 undergraduate students, 85 Masters students and 7 PhD students enrolled in the School. Over the span of my 30+ years at the University I was a member of and chaired several national and international boards and committees and advised organizations around the world including the WHO, European Commission and the TicSalut Scientific Council in Catalonia Spain. In 2004, an Endowment Fund at the University of Victoria, in the name of Denis and Pat Protti, was established by the Partnership & Productivity Colloquium \u2013 a group I founded in 1984 \u2013 for our contributions to Canada\u2019s healthcare system. I was active professionally. In 1972, I was a founding member of the American Medical Informatics Association. I participated in the founding and formation of nd COACH in 1975 and became its 2 President and was granted life membership in 1982. Today, COACH: Canada's Health Informatics Association provides access to a diverse community of over 1500 professionals. In 1989, I was elected a Fellow of the American College of Medical Informatics. I was given a life membership in the British Computer Society in 2003. I served as Canada\u2019s representative on IMIA\u2019s W.G. 1 - Education from 1982 \u2013 1999, sitting as chair from 1989 \u2013 1995. I was also the Canadian representative on W.G. 4 - Data Protection in Health Information Systems from 1979 \u2013 1989. In 1989, our School hosted a successful IMIA conference in Victoria which subsequently led to co-authoring, with Jochen Moehr and Roger Salamon, the Proceedings of \"Medical Informatics and Education: Review of an IMIA Conference\". I still remember Don Lindberg announcing at our closing dinner that this was a full-fledged mini-MEDINFO conference. In 1994, my sabbatical took us to the University of Manchester where I worked in Vic Peel\u2019s new Health Informatics Department for 4 months. That was the start of a 20- year journey where I returned to Europe at least once a year to conduct research and consult until 2014. One of my high points was when I developed the evaluation methodology that was used to monitor the local implementation of England\u2019s national Information for Health Strategy for the English National Health Service (NHS). For two years, the entire health system was using what were called \u201cThe Protti Scores\u201d. In 2009, I was kindly awarded a Doctor of Science from City University of London for my contributions to the British health care system. I stepped down as Director of the School in 1994 and retired from teaching in 2010. I continued to be active in the field until I decided in 2016 to devote my intellectual energies to documenting my Italian and French roots \u2013 I had caught the genealogical disease. ", "Fern\u00e1n Gonzalez Bernaldo de Quir\u00f3s": "Minister of Health, Buenos Aires Vice-Director of Strategic Planning Director of the Master\u2019s Degree Program on Health Informatics Director of the Master\u2019s Degree Program on Clinical Research Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires I studied medicine and received the M.D. degree with honors from the University of Buenos Aires in 1987 and was also awarded a MSc degree by the Universidad Oberta de Catalu\u00f1a in Spain. In 1994 I completed a residency and was appointed to the Department of Internal Medicine at the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires (HIBA) in a new field dedicated to knowledge management for patient care and clinical F.G.B. de Quir\u00f3s, MD, MSc, research. I visited different Departments of Medical Informatics that were pioneers in the discipline in the US FACMI, FIAHSI and was mostly inspired by Kaiser Permanente. Returning to Buenos Aires, I decided to build a team that included people from different disciplines so as to build a Health Information System. In 1995, I became Medical Manager of the Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) \u201cPlan de Salud\u201d of HIBA, for which we developed a program for the management of chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and asthma. It integrated data from different sources in order to perform follow-ups on patients based on their individual risk factors. An information system was then developed to automatically recognize and generate alerts for patients with clinical or attitudinal findings incongruent with expected results as defined in clinical practice guidelines and reported in the first version of an EHR developed in-house. This system generated patient contact lists, and these in turn generated e-mail reminders for patients. It also automatically took into account the clinical findings and the record of examinations and procedures performed, allowing for personalized patient follow-ups. This software was implemented in JAVA and was standards-based. Experience with it was presented to different health care authorities at the national and regional levels as an example of the implementation of a regional Chronic Care Model. This first success enabled me to establish a Department of Health Informatics at HIBA in 1999, leading to the development of an in-house hospital information system (HIS) based on HL7 standards for interoperability between the EHR and the legacy systems. This HIS system, which remains an ongoing effort, is based on interoperable components that provide knowledge and information to clinicians and managers, and continues to evolve based on the data captured, processed, and analyzed from the HIBA clinical sources. It includes an EHR with a CPOE and a CDSS and a personal health record portal. The EHR, called ITALICA, is designed to handle data for outpatient, home care, inpatient, and emergency care. It allows online tracking of hospital inpatients (admission, transfer, and discharge) and produces a discharge summary with automatic coding and grouping by DRGs. The system has an application for supporting clinical research studies and visualization of results from the EHR that includes a PACS for access to images associated with the patient. ITALICA has been used as a \u201ccase study\u201d on HIS development and implementation and was accredited at HIMSS Level 7 in 2017.  It is a well-known resource among healthcare institutions in Latin America and has led me to become an advisor for national and regional authorities on HIS development. I have also been involved in education and training in clinical informatics at the institutional and individual level, developing research and educational programs in Health Informatics, Disease Management, Internal Medicine, and Human Physiology. I have established a 4-year Medical Informatics Residency Program that started in 2001 at HIBA. More than 30 fellows have been trained in these programs under the supervision of the Department Research and Education at HIBA, and we started the first Residency Training Program in Clinical Informatics and the Medical Informatics Specialist Career, both approved by the Argentine Ministry of Education. I also initiated fellowship programs in Healthcare Management in 1998, Clinical Management and Chronic Disease Management in 2003, and Clinical Research in Internal Medicine in 2007. I am currently the Vice Director of Strategic Planning, the Chair of Human Physiology at the School of Medicine, and the Head of Research in the Internal Medicine Division of HIBA. I have been leading health information system projects at HIBA for 15 years. Since 2017, I have been coordinating educational projects in medical informatics in Latin America for IMIA-LAC. Since 2013, I have worked on the eHealth Technical Advisory Group that provides support to the work of WHO in the area of eHealth. I was elected an ACMI fellow in 2011 and a Fellow of the International Academy of Health Sciences Informatics (IAHSI) in 2017, when I was also recognized with the IMIA Fran\u00e7ois Gr\u00e9my Award of Excellence. Twenty-five years after initiating ITALICA, our main lesson learnt is that the key for successful in-house HIS development is to build a multidisciplinary professional team. This team not only develops and maintains the HIS, but at the same time innovates and carries out research, so as to keep up with the evolving dynamics of the discipline. In this way, one can best navigate based on experience and evidence the new challenges and opportunities that continuously arise in the discipline. This is the reason why we have a highly integrated university and hospital department of Health Informatics offering a MSc and residency training program on Health Informatics between them. Having a multidisciplinary professional team with an in-house developed HIS allows us to use the clinical workflow-generated information that the Hospital needs for its management without the clinical workflow being overly influenced by the management information needs. We believe that is essential in allowing us to fully implement an HIS with highly satisfied clinical users. Methods of Information in Medicine, 2017; 1:e13-e19 ", "Thomas C. Rindfleisch": "Senior Research Scientist, Emeritus, Stanford University Director, Knowledge Systems Laboratory (Stanford) Director, National SUMEX-AIM Computer Resource (Stanford) CTO & VP Research & Development, SKOLAR, Inc. BS & MS (Physics), FACMI, FAAAS My interests in BMHI reach back to my earliest professional career. My formal training is in theoretical physics (Purdue University and the California Institute of Technology). In parallel with my graduate studies in the early 1960s, I worked at the Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in the Space Sciences Division on the earliest unmanned NASA spacecraft missions to the moon and Mars (Ranger, Surveyor, Mariner, and others). This work centered on the invention and development of digital image processing techniques, in collaboration with Dr. Robert Nathan, for the enhancement and automated extraction of features characterizing the content of television images from these missions. Processing included removing electronic noise, geometric distortions, and photometric distortions, as well enhancing contrast. One of the most interesting scientific applications was the development of a technique to use quantitative photometric information to infer surface slopes and 3- dimensional topography from monoscopic Ranger spacecraft images of the moon (1965). These topographic maps were then used to test land a computer model of the subsequent Surveyor lander spacecraft to test whether or not it might tip over on sharp slopes or encounter rocks that could penetrate its lower structures. The success of this work quickly suggested other applications of these technologies to areas like biomedical imagery, forensic imagery, and earth resources imagery. Experiments in these areas led to a funding award in the late 1960s from the National Institutes of Health, Division of Research Resources (DRR, under Drs. William Raub and William Baker). With this funding we developed an automated karyotyping system, tools to enhance and outline areas of interest in x-ray images, and experiments on other modes of imagery from microscopy and radiology. Moving to Stanford University \u2014 the Foundations of Medical Informatics Research. In the late 1960s, several events occurred that shaped my future work in BMHI at Stanford. The first followed from the planning for a series of more sophisticated missions to Mars (Mariner 1969, Mars Orbiter, and Viking Lander) with the ultimate objective of testing the Mars environment for the possibility of life forms. As a participant in the planning for these missions, I had the good fortune to meet Profs Joshua Lederberg and Elliott Levinthal who were members of the scientific teams interested in television imagery and other experimental payloads important to exobiology investigations\u2014a term coined by Lederberg. The second event followed from Lederberg\u2019s invention of his dendritic algorithm for enumerating isomeric biomolecular structures in the mid-1960s. By the late 1960s, Lederberg, along with computer scientists Edward Feigenbaum and Bruce Buchanan, and chemist Carl Djerassi, had received NIH funding (through DRR) for the DENDRAL project. DENDRAL was an artificial intelligence research project to develop an expert system to infer the unknown structures of interesting biomolecules using clues from physical chemistry methodologies (e.g., gas  chromatography, low- and high-resolution mass spectrometry, infrared spectrometry, etc.) and a rule-base of molecular fragmentation events in mass spectrometers. The third was a spin-off of the work on unmanned space missions. Because round- trip communications times are so long for deep space missions, increased on-board intelligence would be needed to guide spacecraft systems more autonomously. This led to a proposal to start an artificial intelligence group at JPL. Such a step was a difficult sell to JPL/NASA because the state of AI was still nascent, the risks were high, and the prospects of a significant investment in needed equipment and personnel was dubious. These events came together to create a most propitious opportunity that determined my future research course in BMHI. I was invited to join the DENDRAL project at Stanford, in Lederberg\u2019s eclectic and interdisciplinary Department of Genetics, and assume responsibility for the technical direction and management of a group developing intelligent data systems for low- and high-resolution gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry instruments for biochemical research in the Depts. of Genetics and Chemistry. These systems provided fully automated acquisition and analysis of instrument data as inputs for the DENDRAL molecular-structure interpretation programs. One of these systems was adopted by the Environmental Protection Agency as their standard GC/MS analysis tool (1983). The rich and productive collaboration among the multidisciplinary DENDRAL team sparked a whole new vision of how to use computation and communication technologies to bring together communities of researchers bridging geographic boundaries. While early prototypes of microchip computing technologies, open network systems such as the ARPANET, and increasingly sophisticated interactive software tools were far from perfected, by the early 1970s we envisioned a national community of projects working on applications of artificial intelligence in medicine (AIM) that could collaborate through the use of shared or interconnected computing environments. We proposed a project, called SUMEX-AIM (Stanford University Medical Experimental Computer for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine), to the NIH DRR in 1972. The birthing process was very difficult because of the emerging nature of the computing, communications, and AI technologies and the skepticism of peer reviewers about supporting such a risky project. The Stanford team persisted through three intense site visits and four versions of the proposal and by the end of 1973 we received word that our project would be funded. By early 1974 we began building the national SUMEX-AIM resource. I became Director of SUMEX-AIM and was responsible for the administrative management of the resource and for the technical direction of the systems effort that developed, integrated, and operated distributed computing resources for the Stanford and national SUMEX-AIM user communities. SUMEX was the first non-DoD computer system on the early 63-node ARPANET (we were node 56), thanks to complementary funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for our computer science research under Feigenbaum and Lederberg. SUMEX developed and enhanced tools to facilitate collaboration among remote users, including early electronic mail and bulletin board technologies (e.g., MM, the IMAP protocol, and BBD); shared software development tools (e.g., InterLisp packages, frameworks for knowledge representation and heuristic problem solving, and machine independent languages such as MainSAIL); and remote access information dissemination services (e.g., the open- source InfoMac resource). SUMEX and the Computer Science Department implemented the first local area networks at Stanford, based on the Ethernet technology developed at Xerox PARC as well as other early protocols to support experimental Lisp machines.  SUMEX vigorously adapted early workstation, graphics user interface, and mobile systems technologies to improve human interactions with expert systems. Through its lifetime (1973\u20131992), SUMEX evolved through seven generations of computing technology and communications services and produced many innovative software systems over the years. Our research led to a number of successful start-up companies, including Cisco Systems. All of this work was driven by real-world needs of the national SUMEX-AIM community, which consisted initially of five projects at Stanford, Rutgers University, and the University of Pittsburgh. This community grew to 20 projects over the lifetime of the SUMEX resource and was the home of many of the best-known expert AI systems (e.g., DENDRAL, INTERNIST, MYCIN/EMYCIN, SECS, CASNET/Glaucoma, PUFF/VM, PathFinder, ONCOCIN, MOLGEN, PROT\u00c9G\u00c9, ACT, PARRY, and many others). Maturation of the Field of Informatics. The SUMEX-AIM national resource was funded for nearly 20 years, under a succession of principle investigators: Joshua Lederberg (1973-1976), Edward Feigenbaum (1976-1983), and Edward Shortliffe (1983-1992). I served as resource director during this entire period, with additional responsibilities as Director of the Knowledge Systems Laboratory (KSL) which served as the umbrella organization for interdisciplinary artificial intelligence research in the Stanford Heuristic Programming Project (Dept. of Computer Science), the Medical Computer Science Group (Dept. of Medicine), and the SUMEX Systems Group (Depts. of Computer Science and Medicine). In 1992, with the wide availability of cost-effective, personal computing resources, funding for SUMEX-AIM ceased and the resource morphed into the Center for Advanced Medical Informatics at Stanford (CAMIS) under Prof. Shortliffe. I served as CAMIS Director and principal investigator from 1994-1995 during Shortliffe\u2019s sabbatical. CAMIS was funded by NIH/NLM as a national collaborative resource for applications of computer-science and decision-support technologies in biomedicine. As an example of our work, I collaborated with Paul Clayton (Columbia University) and others on important privacy and security issues in health care and was a member of the National Research Council study group that produced an influential report in 1997 on best security practices in modern health care organizations. Other research included context-based information retrieval and management architectures based on world-wide web protocols. In 1990 we had proposed a digital library system that was to support the four departments constituting the Center for Molecular and Genetic Medicine at Stanford. This proposal was premature at the time and was not funded. By the mid-1990s however, early web production of professional biomedical journals became available, e.g., by HighWire Press under the Stanford University Library. At this point, given my interests in information retrieval and management, I took over as Director of the Lane Medical Library in the Stanford School of Medicine following the retirement of the previous director. My mission was to convert Lane into a digital library to serve the Stanford community. This transition involved significant reorientation of the library staff and augmentation of the information technology of the library. This work resulted in several major steps. First we did bring on-line a number of early journals (e.g., the Journal of Biological Chemistry, Journal of Cell Biology, Journal of Experimental Medicine, Proceedings National Academy of Sciences USA, and Science) and were able to measure and compare usage in digital and hardcopy form. The results were dramatic\u2014digital forms were used around twenty times more than the hardcopy journals.  Second, we acquired video equipment to record all of the lecture classes required of medical students and to make them available on-line for review and study. And third I started a project with Dr. Kenneth Melmon, Associate Dean for Continuing Education, called SHINE (Stanford Health Information Network for Education). The goal of this latter project was to develop an open architecture for making digital information resources (e.g., practice guidelines, literature, textbooks, drug databases, personalized information resources, etc.) available to practicing physicians in their workplaces to answer the inevitable questions that come up in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Dr. Melmon was able to convince the American Medical Association Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to allow Category 1 credits for using SHINE effectively in practice. SHINE eventually spun off from Stanford as a commercial company called SKOLAR, having developed and demonstrated a powerful system for more effective physician practice and education. SKOLAR was eventually purchased by Wolters Kluwer and is part of their offerings for decision support and continuing education. What Lies Ahead? SUMEX-AIM and its successors successfully introduced and proved the powerful paradigm of computer network-based collaboration that powers much of the world\u2019s research today. It also laid the groundwork for artificial intelligence applications in diverse areas of basic research and clinical care in biomedicine. Many of the problems undertaken in the early years continue to present challenges \u2014 e.g., effective decision support, interoperating information systems, extraction of usable clinical knowledge from databases of patient experience, bringing basic research to clinical practice, sharing nomenclatures and semantic knowledge representations, protecting privacy and security, continuing education, workplace integration, and so on. It has been a privilege to work on these problems for so many years, during an era of explosive technology innovation, and with such a remarkable community of collaborators and outstanding students. Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 1998; 5:404-411 ", "Cornelius Rosse": "Professor Emeritus, Department of Biological Structure Joint Professor Emeritus Department of Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education University of Washington From Cadaver to Foundational Model of Anatomy It did not take long for me to realize that dealing with my patients\u2019 problems exacted a greater emotional toll on me than I was willing to pay. Therefore, I decided to devote my career to teaching and research. This decision germinated from the rewarding experience I had gained during a year I spent as a medical student on a research project in hematopoiesis, combined with a teaching assistantship in the anatomy lab. Both experiences proved to be prophetic choices. The evolution of the research project brought me, years later, from England to the University of Washington; the teaching of anatomy has led me to anatomical knowledge representation, which meant that I became engaged in bioinformatics research, an experience that led eventually to the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA). The FMA: There are two factors that accounted for my transformation from an anatomy teacher to an ontologist. One was the environment in which I found myself at the University of Washington; the second was my dedication to instilling in my students\u2019 habits of mind for learning anatomy through reasoning instead of rote memorization. The environment. I was fortunate in that I landed in an eclectic, research-oriented anatomy department, one of its programs being in molecular structure: data obtained by x-ray crystallography were visualized by 3D computer graphics. Why not adapt the same technique to visualizing anatomy? The initial steps were taken by my neuro-anatomist colleagues, who produced a segmented 3D model from slices of a cadaver brain. The revolving realistic model, suspended in space, opened my eyes to the potential for extending this work to the whole body. This was the first step toward the Digital Anatomist and, as far as we can tell, the first 3D representation of macroscopic (gross) anatomy on the computer screen. A site visit from the National Library of Medicine (NLM) resulted in our first funded grant, making it possible to build a research team dedicated to structural informatics, chiefly under the leadership of Jim Brinkley. The use of the Digital Anatomist atlases has spread to nearly one hundred countries, but even more important was the fact that they provided the impetus for NLM to initiate the Visible Human project. In addition, our own program benefited greatly from the interest that graduate students in computer science began to show in the challenges presented by spatial representations of the human body. Graduate students have remained a significant component of our program ever since. Anatomical reasoning. When I began to teach anatomy, I wanted to help my students approach anatomy as a foundation for the physical exam rather than as an exercise in rote memorization. The first requirement was to cultivate skills for spatial visualization, such as seeing in the mind\u2019s eye the surface a grapefruit cut along planes at ninety degrees to one another, or even something as simple as visualizing where your toothbrush  is in your bathroom. The purpose of such games was to cultivate an ability in the student to \u201csee\u201d, for example, the organ that touches the anterior surface of the left kidney, with the aim that this ability would eventually become second nature. The student could test the validity of the guesses (hypotheses) arrived at in this way by referring to an atlas, or even better, to the Digital Anatomist, a process which transformed the exercise into an active learning experience, whether the initial guess was right or wrong. The second requirement was to recognize the kinds of information that are associated with different kinds of anatomical entities. For example, all muscles have a site of origin and a site of insertion; nerves also have origin but, unlike muscles, they also have a path or course, branches and targets that they innervate; and so on. Thus we could develop what we called a \u2018knowledge organization template\u2019 that acted as a frame with slots in it for the properties that are shared by all anatomical entities of a given kind. Then for any given structure, the contents (values) of the template slots could be reasoned by merging the template with a visualization exercise. Did Mark Musen presciently build Prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s frame-based system for representing exactly this kind of information? This kind of reasoning and deductive approach opens the door for a traditionally trained anatomist to a sophisticated knowledge-authoring tool such as Prot\u00e9g\u00e9. For us anatomists, who had no training in computer science or informatics, Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 turned out to be exactly the right tool for building the FMA. Collaborators: That the FMA is unlike any time-honored anatomical knowledge source, and that I personally have been transformed from a clinically trained anatomy teacher into an ontologist, is attributable, above all, to the individuals that I had the good fortune to encounter and to collaborate with. After presenting a paper at a SCAMC meeting about the Digital Anatomist, I heard Alexa McCray give a talk about UMLS, with some reference to its anatomy component. I remember it hit me like a ton of bricks that this was the domain where I had to make my contribution. I credit Alexa for having confidence in this anatomist and encouraging me to apply for a contract that was, in time, awarded to us for the \u201cenhancement of the anatomy content of UMLS\u201d. This was the beginning of the FMA. Without NLM\u2019s support neither the Digital Anatomist nor the FMA would exist. In addition to the benefits of the funding we received from, NLM has exerted a profound influence on the course of my professional future by inviting me to serve on the Biomedical Library Review Committee (BLRC). That experience provided me with the background for becoming integrated into biomedical informatics research, and henceforth I devoted my academic endeavors to this domain. This motivation was most directly shaped and influenced by my interactions with two fellow members of the BLRC, namely Mark Musen and Casimir Kulikowski. The transition from biological bench research to bioinformatics research would not have been possible without an enduring collaboration with Jim Brinkley, whom I had recruited from Stanford. Jim and his students taught me that it was possible to build a symbolic model of anatomy that could parallel and complement the graphical representation of physical entities that constitute the body. Through a series of iterations of increasing expressivity, this model became the Foundational Model of Anatomy. The godfather of the FMA is Mark Musen, who coined the term and who, together with Natasha Noy, has educated and initiated us in the structure and use of Prot\u00e9g\u00e9. The review of our first comprehensive report on the FMA (2003) was positive, but one of the reviewers, though overall supportive, was brutally critical. His critique revealed to me how na\u00efve my views still were and how much I still had to learn. I felt it  mandatory to link up with this individual and ultimately prevailed on the editor to disclose his identity. It was, of course, Barry Smith. Through our ensuing and extensive collaboration, he taught me how to think. It is from him that I learned what ontology is really about, how it relates to philosophy and, at the other end of the spectrum, how my work is related to both. I finally understood the difference between a \u2018structured vocabulary\u2019 and an ontology. While I owe a great debt to Mark Musen and Barry Smith for introducing me to, and guiding me in, the domain of ontology, I also want to pay homage to those members of the structural informatics group who have populated the FMA with hundreds of thousands of data entries and continue to do so to this day. In the last analysis, and on the most practical level, the FMA became what it is through their dedication, as well as our arguments and trials and errors; it is due to them that the FMA is regarded by leaders in the field as an example of a principled ontology. I want to single out Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Mejino (known to his friends as Onard) and Augusto Agoncillo (both of whom, like I, switched from clinical medicine to ontology) and Todd Detweiler, a gifted and inventive programmer, who has greatly facilitated not only data entry and auditing, but also the migration of the FMA from one authoring system such as Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to another, such as OWL. I want to conclude by returning to Onard Mejino who, on my retirement, assumed the role of curator of the FMA and is responsible for greatly enhancing its adaptation in a growing number of clinical and biomedical research areas. It is largely the result of his efforts that the FMA has come to be regarded more and more as a reference ontology for anatomy. My association with Onard goes back to the days when we used to extract bone marrow from the femora of mice. His journey in biomedical informatics and ontology parallels mine. In fact, since my retirement, he has overtaken me. I am indebted to him for his continuing commitment to the future of the FMA. Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 2003; 36:478-500 ", "Virginia K. Saba": "Distinguished Scholar, Emeritus, Georgetown University Adjunct Professor, Uniformed Services University CEO & President, SabaCare Inc. Past Chair-IMIA/SIG-NI A Nursing Pioneer\u2019s Story My involvement with Computers and Informatics started around the same time as the \u2018Computer\u2019, now called \u2018Informatics\u2019, V.K. Saba, EdD, RN, FACMI, FAAN, LL was introduced in the healthcare industry as a \u2018number crunching\u2019 machine. As the computer advanced, my knowledge of computers also advanced, making me a nursing pioneer in this new field. For over 40 years the \u2018computer\u2019 became the focus of my professional career. My career ranged from my initial position as a government official and leader to faculty positions in academia, and today to serving as a freelance nursing informatics (NI) consultant specializing in terminologies and data standards. During this time, I both led and served as a member of several national committees that developed criteria, standards, and other requirements related to the introduction of the computer in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) for the healthcare industry including nursing. My first exposure to the computer was as a new professional nurse responsible for supervising approximately 50 coders assembled to keyboard for computer processing the data from a national study conducted by National Institute of Health (NIH) on the entire perinatal experience of 50,000 pregnant women. The key statistician on the study team and I disagreed with the research findings on the data related to the women\u2019s \u2018vaginal dilation of greater than 10 centimeters\u2019 during the Delivery Phase which he interpreted as new statistical facts and I, as coding errors. This encounter insulted my professionalism and led to my taking my first course on computers, \u2018What is the computer?\u2019, offered by the Department of Defense, one of the only sources of information on this new \u2018giant processing machine\u2019 at that time. The \u2018computer\u2019 and my persistent question as to \u2018How can the computer be used in nursing?\u2019 became my obsession for my entire professional career. My next exposure was as a Nurse Officer with the Division of Nursing (DN) in the US Public Health Service (PHS) assigned to providing nursing support to the DN statistical branch responsible for conducting national nursing surveys and studies that impacted the health of the nation. These projects began to require computer knowledge for the design, coding, and processing of their data collection forms as well as the analyses of the collected data. These new tools expanded my computer career into this new healthcare specialty. My involvement generally focused on whether the healthcare data collected were useful for the DN federal initiatives as well as for the nursing profession. For example, we identified what data from the federal initiative, the \u2018Annual Survey of Public Health Nursing (PHN)\u2019 could be submitted as background data to support the DN\u2019s contribution to the federal legislation for the passage of \u2018Medicare and Medicaid Act of 1966\u2019. Another study, supported by the DN, determined whether the coding structure for the \u201cSystematic Nursing Assessment\u201d data collection tool being developed by a healthcare agency could collect the proposed \u2018Nursing Assessment\u2019 data.  These DN surveys and research studies focusing on national initiatives and nursing issues became my educational laboratory on the uses of computer and this merged with my knowledge of the nursing practice. However, they never answered my question \u2018How can the computer be used in nursing?\u2019 This question continued to spark my interest in this new nursing field and became my rationale to continue my computer education by completing both a Master\u2019s Degree in Computer Science and a Doctoral Degree in 1981 on the Science of Technology Management Information from American University, Washington, DC. The combination of my experiences with the technology requirements of the DN surveys and research studies made my PHS role visible as a national nursing consultant with computer/ technology expertise. Another national challenge emerged from passage of the Medicare & Medicaid Legislation of 1966. The legislation required that payment data be collected on Reimbursement Forms for the services provided by the nurses and other healthcare professionals. This federal regulation impacted the administration of the Public Health/ Home Health Agencies by requiring new innovative electronic systems to support them. In 1973, I collaborated with the National League for Nursing (NLN) and together we conducted the first national nursing computer conference, entitled \u2018Management Systems for Public Health/Community Health Agencies\u2019. The conference was so successful that between 1974 and 1975 a follow-up series of workshops were held around the country culminating in 1976 with a summary conference in Washington, DC. At this conference, a commercial computer vendor demonstrated the first computer application for the processing of Medicare Reimbursement Forms. This initiative concluded in 1978 when we prepared and published a compendium of over 40 selected computerized Management Information Systems (MIS) for PH/CH Agencies from across the country. These four publications became the first set of MIS computer guides that supported the Medicare legislation. Also during the 1970s, many computer systems were beginning to be implemented in the country\u2019s hospitals starting with \u2018number crunching\u2019 applications and census count systems -- admissions, discharges and transfers (ADTs). Other applications were also being developed such as the documentation of standardized nursing plans of care (POCs). This development began to answer my question \u2018How can the computer be used in nursing? Once again in my role in the DN, I was required to provide consultation, conduct workshops, and help the hospital nursing departments understand the use of computers for nurse staffing, patient acuity, nursing plans of care, costing, etc. By the late 1970s my pioneering efforts on the use of computers in healthcare and nursing were visible to the nations\u2019 professional nurses in both hospitals and PH/CH agencies. Out of this visibility came many of the \u2018firsts\u2019 that I initiated on integrating computers into the nursing profession. Examples of a few of the early \u2018firsts\u2019 include my consultation in 1978 with Dr. Harriet Werley to identify computer literate professionals in the country to invite to her first invitational technology research conference \u2018Nursing Information Systems\u2019, my presentations on the uses of the computer for healthcare and nursing services at numerous conferences and workshops including the first Tri-Service Medical Information System (TRIMIS) conference in 1979 held by the Army Nurse Consultant Team at Walter Reed Hospital, and the first academic workshop on this same topic conducted in 1980 by the University of Akron School of Nursing. This continued throughout the 1980s and in 1981, we initiated a major milestone conference on computers and nursing, the first of five national conferences held at the Clinical Center of the NIH, a collaboration between Ruth Carlson, Educational Director of the Clinical Center, myself, representing the DN, PHS, and Dorothy Pocklington,  representing the Army Nurse Consultant Team (TRIMIS). Over 700 nurse administrators, practitioners, clinicians, educators and researchers from across the country attended this first conference, seeking information on and live applications for this emerging field. Also in 1981, I initiated another milestone event by organizing and conducting with the assistance of Rita Zielstroff, the first nursing sessions at the \u2018Fifth Annual Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care (SCAMC)\u2019. At that meeting the nurse attendees, Diane Skiba, Roy Simpson, and Judy Ozbolt, with my DN support, formed the \u2018First Special Interest Group for Nurses at SCAMC\u2019, a networking organization which continues today. I also attended and presented a paper at my first Medinfo conference in 1983 in Amsterdam. These were just a few of my career activities in the DN of the PHS where I served as a national nursing office and consultant initiating the integration of computers in the nursing profession. My question, \u2018How can the computer be used in nursing?\u2019 remained unsolved. Upon retiring from the PHS in the mid-1980s, I took a faculty teaching position as an Associate Professor at Georgetown University, School of Nursing (GT-SON) and was later honored to receive the title of Distinguished Scholar. The GT-SON was one of the first universities to offer my computer courses to both undergraduate and graduate students as a means of integrating this new specialty into their student education. Since there were no textbooks available, my role required developing educational materials specific for teaching this new specialty. In 1986, I co-authored and published one of the first textbooks with Kathleen McCormick, entitled the \u201cEssentials of Computers for th Nurses\u201d (7 Edition published in 2020). My courses always included using laboratory experience at the newly established \u2018Apple Mac Laboratory\u2019 at the GTU Medical School\u2019s Dahlgren library to teach students how to search the nursing literature from the National Library of Medicine\u2019s MEDLINE by computer. As the field of computing advanced, we in the SON established our own computer laboratory for teaching students \u201chands-on\u201d computing and other technological media such as CD ROMS for clinical simulation experiences. The student experience advanced, expanded, and evolved with the emergence of the Internet to include on-line, real time literature searches as well as World Wide Web (WWW) communicating with other nursing sites around the world. During my tenure at GTU I also became involved with the integration of computers into our professional nursing organizations\u2014the American Nurses Association (ANA) and the National League for Nursing. In 1986, with Dr. Werley, I established the first Council on Computer Applications in Nursing (CCAIN) at the ANA and became one of the initial five board members, all of us, nursing pioneers: Harrient Werley, Chair, Rita Zielstorff, Kathleen McCormick, Ivo Abraham, and myself. The CCAIN became a powerful force that promoted numerous computer activities in the nursing profession and moved this specialty forward. Our accomplishments are numerous and include: a) submitting Resolutions to the ANA General Assembly on recommending the use of computers in the nursing profession; b) hosting demonstration sessions of computer applications in nursing at the ANA conventions; c) initiating the first ANA newsletter (Input-Output) which led to today\u2019s current commercial journal, Computers in Nursing; d) and soliciting and publishing the first set of ANA reports on this new nursing specialty, namely, computers in nursing practice, education, research, and management. These reports addressed the need to integrate computers in nursing but did not specifically answer my question: \u2018How can the computer be used in nursing?\u2019 During my tenure at GTU I also conducted my research on computers in nursing. In 1988 I received a contract and three years of funding from the federal government (HCFA) to conduct a national study to evaluate services provided by PH/CH, Hospital  and other Healthcare Facilities and to develop a classification method to measure resource needs and outcomes. As Principal Investigator and Project Director and with a multi-disciplinary research team, we conducted one of the first national studies designed to collect and analyze patient care service data. This proved to be a successful descriptive national study on this field of healthcare. The study also collected approximately 40,000 patient problems and/or diagnoses and over 70,000 nursing services statements from almost 9,000 patients on the patients\u2019 entire episodes of illness. Using \u2018keyword sorts\u2019, statistical analyses, and other vocabulary processing activities I developed today\u2019s Clinical Care Classification (CCC) System, also known as Home Health Care Classification (HHCC). This research provides a standardized language and terminology for nursing and serves as a means of documenting nursing practice and patient care by computer. In 1992, the ANA approved \u2018Nursing Informatics\u2019 (NI) (new term from France) as a new nursing specialty and subsequently developed its scope of practice, guidelines, and a certification program for Nursing informatics (NI) Experts. During that year the CCAIN also developed the criteria and \u2018recognized\u2019 the first four nursing terminologies, including the CCC System, for the documentation of nursing practice by computer. In summary, the pioneering initiatives by myself and with a few other pioneer nursing leaders in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, integrated this new nursing specialty of NI into the nursing profession. By the early 2000s the NI field was populated with a cadre of NI Experts making this new nursing specialty visible and viable. The field continues to develop and expand. Postscript: Today, I continue to serve as a Nursing Informatics (NI) Consultant, focusing on the national Standards and Terminologies for the electronic health record (EHR) systems and on the documentation of nursing practice using a standardized Clinical Care Classification (CCC) System. Today\u2019s CCC System serves as a framework for documenting nursing practice following the six steps of the nursing process representing professional nursing practice as recommended by the ANA. The CCC System consists of: a) CCC of 176 Nursing Diagnoses; b) CCC of 804 Nursing Interventions Actions; and c) CCC of 528 Nursing Outcomes\u2014all of which are classified by 21 Care Components to form one integrated system. Thus I have resolved my question: \u2018The CCC System, a standardized coded nursing term inology, can be used to computerize nursing practice?\u2019 Computers, Informatics, Nursing, 2007; 25:324-331 ", "Charles Safran": "Professor of Medicine Harvard Medical School In the fall of 1968, my senior year in high school, the woodworking shop was converted into a computer room. With great fanfare, John Kemeny, a friend of the head of our mathematics department from their time on the Manhattan Project and the co-developer of the BASIC programming language, dedicated the new PDP8/S. I wrote a program to play tic-tac-toe based upon a magic square. I caught the programming bug and my career direction was altered. C. Safran, MD In college at Tufts University, I liked the kind of mathematics (pure as opposed to applied) where you got credit for the process (proof) rather than the numerical answer. I finished the requirements for my master\u2019s in mathematical logic way before finishing my liberal arts degree. My master\u2019s thesis, which explored the recent proof that Hilbert\u2019s 10th problem was unsolvable, was in an area of mathematics known as the theory of computation. In the winter of 1973, my thesis advisor, David Isles, gave me an article from Psychology Today interviewing Terry Winograd, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who had built an early artificial intelligence (AI) program called SHURDLU. The program could understand natural language in the constrained world of blocks. He encouraged me to go over to the AI Lab at MIT, learn about AI and report to him about it. My experience at MIT shaped my career in clinical informatics, guided me toward medical school, and resulted in professional and personal relationships that I still enjoy today. At MIT a group headed by Tony Gorry, called the Clinical Decision-Making Group (now called the Medical Decision-Making Group), was trying to build a program that could take a \u201cpresent illness\u201d history directly from a patient. I was intrigued and thought that maybe computers and medicine could be a good future for me. Tony Gorry had been working with Octo Barnett from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) on the sequential use of Bayes Theorem to give a probabilistic foundation for medical diagnosis. My job as the first and only programmer of the Medical Decision-Making Group was to develop a representation language for the Present Illness Program. Tony called this language GOBBLE because he wanted to gobble up medical facts and relationships like \u201cpedal edema was a finding in patients with acute glomerulonephritis.\u201d The doctors at Tufts NEMC began working with Tony to include therapy when considering diagnosis using Decision Theory as a framework. Dr. Schwartz, after attending a grand round at Tufts NEMC on the staging of patients with Hodgkin\u2019s disease, suggested to Dr. Jane Desforges that Decision Analysis or Cost/Benefit would be the perfect way to evaluate the invasive tests and treatments in common use. Tony then volunteered me to work with the hematologists and oncologists to develop a decision tree and then develop a computer program to provide support for their decision-making challenges. I began work on a Clinical Decision Support System that would interact with doctors in the Lymphoma Unit of Tufts NEMC and not only provide diagnostic and prognostic information, but also offer a diagnostic plan. This plan would be a sequence  of tests leading to treatment based on the pattern of positive and negative test results. I started following Dr. Desforges in her clinic and attending the weekly Lymphoma Unit meetings. Soon, I knew enough about Hodgkin\u2019s disease to ask questions like \u201cWhat was the morbidity from a liver biopsy?\u201d or \u201cWhat was sensitivity or specificity of lymphangiography?\u201d Asking these questions, I was sent to the library to use Index Medicus. I rapidly learned the literature was incomplete, so I naively asked if I could access the hospital\u2019s data. However, the data I was interested in had to be abstracted from paper charts. Moreover, there was not enough data to calculate conditional probabilities, much less joint conditional probabilities. My quest for data took me to the Radiation Oncology department at the Stanford Medical Center. Dr. Henry Kaplan, head of the department and a pioneer in the treatment of Hodgkin\u2019s disease, gave me a flat file of 909 patients who had been staged and treated. The departments of Radiation Oncology at University of Chicago School of Medicine and the Joint Center for Radiation Therapy at Harvard also contributed data. Using these data, I could calculate joint conditional probabilities for real-time decision-making. Within about one year, we had a functioning clinical decision support system available for doctors in the Lymphoma Unit. I wrote at the time that physician reaction was \u201cmild apathy to outright distrust.\u201d Nevertheless, over the first year of operations, fewer diagnostic tests were ordered in the staging process. The physicians at Tufts NEMC applied to the National Cancer Institute for funding to apply Decision Analysis for the management of cancer, and we were awarded three years of support. At this point, however, I began thinking that it might be better to become a physician if I wanted to pursue my work on computers in healthcare. Since I had taken all the premed requirements, I applied to medical school while continuing to work on decision support for diagnostic planning in the treatment of cancer. I was accepted at Tufts University School of Medicine in the fall of 1976. My first two years of medical school were spent learning \u201cfacts,\u201d while in my spare time I earned enough money as a programmer to largely pay my tuition. (Tuition for my first year was only $3,000 and for the second year $6,000!) During the spring of my first year, my first (and only) article in the New England Journal of Medicine was published, which marked me as a computer geek among my peers. In my 3rd year, I began clinical rotations and discovered that I really enjoyed talking with and helping patients, so I turned my focus toward just becoming a good physician. I also met my wife, Donna, a hospital administrator, while I was on rotation in the emergency room. After completing medical school, I trained at the Boston Veterans Administration Hospital for 3 years in internal medicine. With some free elective time after my internship, I began thinking again about computers and what I might do after I finished medical training. I had known Robert Greenes from my time at MIT and visited him at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital (BWH) hoping for some career advice. Fortuitously, he needed some help with a decision analysis project and I needed moonlighting money\u2014our first child had just been born. One afternoon in 1982, I was reading the New England Journal of Medicine and saw an article about PaperChase\u2014the first user-friendly self-service search program for MEDLINE. At that time, the hospital library was on the 2nd floor and my patients were on the 11th floor. If I wanted to find articles to help in the care of my patients, I had to go to the library and search through Index Medicus. Not only did you need to know the proper search terms, but Index Medicus has one index book for each year. So, if you wanted to look up information over the past 10 years, you had to look through 10 volumes of Index Medicus. Reading the NEJM article on PaperChase, I realized I would never  have to go through this aggravation again. I also saw that the article was written by Howard Bleich and Warner Slack, whom I had visited 6 years earlier. I called them to see a demo of PaperChase, and while at Beth Israel Hospital (BIH), I observed their hospital-wide clinical computing system, which was amazing. Apparently, I was at the right place at the right time, because they had just negotiated a contract to port the BIH clinical computing system to BWH and also received a grant to develop PatientChase (eventually called ClinQuery), a user-friendly self-service search program to search the hospital\u2019s clinical database. Having had the good fortune of enjoying time at Harvard since 1983, I look back and realize how exceptional the early days of clinical informatics were. Working with Howard and Warner every day was a unique experience. From Howard, I learned the importance of a clinically intuitive interface for systems that doctors, nurses, and patients would actually use. Howard felt that every extra keystroke took time away from direct patient care. From Warner, I learned the importance of involving patients and families in the design and use of clinical information systems. Howard and Warner were already famous for their seminal work that dated back to the 1960s and were tired of meetings and conferences, so in 1986, when Medinfo and SCAMC were combined, Howard and Warner sent me to the panel on the history of hospital information systems. Because of this I met Jean Raoul Scherer from Geneva for the first time. He asked if he could visit in Boston and of course I said yes. As a result of hosting and getting to know Jean Raoul, he invited me and my family to spend 6 months in Geneva in 1990 working to re-create ClinQuery (a forerunner of I2B2) within the DIOGENE system. This first opportunity to work with international colleagues led to many more, which have not only provided me with lifelong friendships but also changed my parochial Harvard-centric view of the world of clinical informatics. Howard and Warner believed in a tightly integrated system with a single centralized patient registry. Since we were not building \u201cstandalone\u201d departmental systems, this meant our programmers could be agile and just link to data from many systems. For instance, displaying recent BUN and creatinine levels on an IVP radiology procedure request was almost a trivial programming task. However, our approach meant that we did not want departments to buy their own systems. Warner had always preached, \u201cFind the person who can say yes.\u201d My job, unfortunately, was to just say NO to powerful heads of departments. Our tenure at BWH was a time of both great successes and frequent frustrations. BWH had a computer system from Shared Medical Systems (SMS) that Warner joked was better at billing the hospital than the hospital\u2019s clients. We were hired to retire the SMS system and port the BIH system to BWH. We had wonderful colleagues at BWH, including Jonathan Teich and David Bates (still a fellow when we started) who helped evolve, improve, and evaluate the new systems, which they called BICS. Much of what we know about early CPOE comes from Bates, Teich, and the many colleagues supported by their CIO, John Glaser. We thought of the BICS system and the system at BIH (which we called the CCC system) as systems that should be controlled by clinicians for the betterment of patient care. While we were developing the pharmacy system at BWH, we were asked to print a hard copy of all the medication that all the patients in the hospital were taking at least twice a day as a safety backup. We argued that once printed, the information would be out of date: We argued that high-speed line printers would cost $60,000 and we needed two of them in case one broke and this was an unnecessary expense: We argued that our computer system at BIH had only 4 hours of unscheduled downtime each year, so the backup was unnecessary. Finally, Howard just said NO  because he felt the $120,000 cost would ultimately decrease personnel at the patient bedside. The head of pharmacy went to the head of the hospital and Howard was overridden. It was only a few years later that BWH asked our team to teach them to take computing internally. Their terms were generous. We replied that BWH was in breach of contract. BWH replied that they accepted our resignation. Today, the BICS system has been replaced by EPIC, and many of the well-trained physician and nurse informaticians have found roles in other health systems and HIT companies. Our goal was simple: to improve patient care. Our systems were designed to be fast when computers were slow. Howard had the insight that humans were slow, and Warner\u2019s work proved that it takes 7 seconds to put a single question on a computer screen and have a person answer yes, no, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t understand, or skip it. I was taught to get some information onto the computer screen and finish processing in background mode. While computer processing speed is not an issue today (an iPhone today has more storage and CPU than the 5 super-mini Data General computers that ran our entire hospital), sub-second response is still essential for time-constrained clinicians. We recently lost Warner Slack to an insidious and idiopathic pulmonary problem. When I arrived at BIH in 1983, Warner had written a computer program that empowered young women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections to diagnose and treat themselves. At the end of the patient-computer dialogue, the computer would print a prescription that a physician had to sign. Warner asked me to sign this prescription without seeing the patient. My thought process was simple: I trusted Warner and Howard. I have never regretted this decision. Our faculty at the Division of Clinical Informatics in the Department of Medicine at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center has extensively documented our early history through our writing and lectures and videos. We have created a lifework archive for Warner Vincent Slack at hmfpinformatics.org/slack that has many of his full-text articles and many short and long videos that feature both Howard Bleich and Warner Slack describing our work in their own words. The history of the division can be found at www.hmfpinformatics.org. My advice to future informaticians is simple. Find out what you have passion for. Find good mentors. Build your network. ", "Titus Schleyer": "Professor, Biomedical Informatics, Indiana Univ., School of Medicine Research Scientist, Regenstrief Institute Director, Center for Biomedical Informatics, Regenstrief Institute (2013-2015) Associate Professor, University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine (2002-2013) My first encounter with a computer happened when I was about 12 years old, at an agricultural exhibition in Schweinfurt, Germany, where I was born. The funny- looking contraption consisting of a keyboard fused to a T. Schleyer, DMD, PhD small TV monitor (which, as I later found out, was a Commodore Personal Electronic Transactor (PET)) was loaded with the BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) programming language. After I had studied the accompanying instructions for a few minutes and typed in some lines of code, the PET was printing my name in an endless loop all across the screen. Not only did this feel good for my ego, but it also made me realize that \u201cat some point, this machine will rule the world. I need to be able to control it.\u201d This is what got me started in computer programming. A few years later, my programming skills, developed with help of one of the math teachers at my high school, the Celtis Gymnasium, landed me a summer job at a local engineering company. The job was a dream: industrial-strength hardware and software of a caliber that I no chance of finding elsewhere. Programming materials testing software in FORTRAN 77 was intellectually engaging and challenging, but after a few weeks I realized that sitting in front of a very expensive Tektronix graphics terminal producing code for 8 to 10 hours a day wasn\u2019t as much fun as I thought it would be. I then decided to add more interaction with people to what I was going to do with my life. I knew that kind of interaction could be found in healthcare, and decided to become a dentist. During my studies at the Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, I worked in the Department of Medical Informatics under Professor Wolfgang Giere, a medical informatics pioneer in Europe who was very well connected to colleagues and the scene in the US. Through him, I met some of our pioneers, such as Octo Barnett and Clem McDonald. When the full-time staff member who had been managing computers at the dental school quit for a job in industry, he recommended me as his replacement. Thus, I became the only dental student at this time with a university-issued beeper and an office. As I learned more about medical informatics, I thought about potential applications in dentistry. That thinking accelerated as I learned more about programming and databases, and as graphical user interfaces hit the scene in the mid-1980s. I got all excited about the potential for displaying dental charts and the information encoded on them as high-resolution images using individual pixels on the screen rather than blocky characters. I wrote a white paper entitled \u201cThe significance of graphical user interfaces for dentistry.\u201d (\u201cUser interface\u201d literally translates to \u201cuser surface\u201d in German, a fact that is relevant to what follows.) Together with a dental informatics colleague, I met with the Dean and the head of the Department of Restorative Dentistry to talk about my ideas. After half an hour of discussion, the Dean looked at me, pointed to himself and said: \u201cOk, I am the user.\u201d He then touched his bald forehead and said: \u201cAnd, this is my surface. But, what does it have to do with dentistry?\u201d In that instant, I knew that Germany was not the  country in which I could realize my ideas for leveraging the growing power of computers in dentistry. Through my connections with Prof. Giere, I knew that the United States was where \u201cclinical informatics was happening.\u201d There, you could simply unplug the phone from a wall jack, plug in your modem and go online. At that time, doing the same in Germany without contracting with the Postal Service, which controlled the phone service, was actually illegal. My dad regularly got very upset when I opened up the phone jack and went online from our house in Bad Kissingen. But, the thrill of my first live chat on Compuserve with an informatician in the US made up for it. After a lengthy search for a job in the States that didn\u2019t exist (\u201cdental informatician\u201d) I finally assumed the position of Assistant Professor in Operative Dentistry at Temple University School of Dentistry on August 27, 1989. I asked the Dean what my job description was. He said: \u201cMake something good happen with computers.\u201d Over the next 10 years, I proceeded to do exactly that. I had $1.5m in funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that had been allocated to hardware and software as part of the new building that Temple Dental was going to move into. Over the next few years, we devised and implemented a comprehensive strategy for computing, installed several hundred computers supported by a server infrastructure, wrote the first Web-based electronic dental record, and started formal dental informatics training funded by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) and the National Institute of Dental Research\u2014now the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR). Today, in my positions as Professor of Biomedical Informatics at Indiana University and Research Scientist at the Regenstrief Institute, I focus on three main research directions in biomedical informatics: (1) clinical information retrieval, (2) learning health system development and implementation, and (3) leveraging EHR data to create knowledge. 1. Clinical information retrieval: Clinicians have difficulties retrieving the most important information about a patient and their problem(s) effectively and efficiently from current health IT systems. We are addressing these challenges through a number of research projects. One is CareView, which is a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) app that integrates information from a health information exchange directly with the EHR. Another one is collaborative filtering, which will bring Amazon-like recommendation technology to searching and retrieving patient data. 2. Learning health system development and implementation: I am leading the Regenstrief Institute\u2019s recently established Indiana Learning Health System Initiative (ILHSI), which is designed to implement learning health system approaches in a healthcare market (as opposed to a single healthcare institution). Within the ILHSI, we work with various health systems to initiate, implement and evaluate quality improvement and patient safety programs, and scale these programs to all participants in our regional health information exchange. 3. Leveraging EHR data to create knowledge: The amount of electronic data generated by healthcare institutions, clinicians and patients is growing by leaps and bounds. However, our ability to create knowledge from these data efficiently and effectively is lagging behind quite a bit. Within the past few years, I have been focusing on data mining at scale, for instance in helping determine the proportion of patients who do not respond well to cholesterol- lowering therapy with statins, predicting the development of chronic kidney  disease in diabetic patients, and determining risk factors for death from opioid overdose. Over the years, three tenets have become central to my work as an informatics researcher and developer: (1) think big, (2) make a difference in practice, and (3) educate the next generation. 1. Think big: In 2006, Dr. Asim Smailagic from Carnegie Mellon University radically changed my perception of what we could and should achieve in applied research. Dr. Thankam Thyvalikakath, then a trainee of mine who was also being mentored by Asim, had just finished giving a presentation of her project plan to develop an enhanced interface for electronic dental records. Asim asked me: \u201cSo, what improvement in efficiency for dental practice do you expect to come out of this project?\u201d I replied: \u201cOh, about 3-5%, if we are lucky.\u201d He focused a steely gaze on me and said: \u201cI don\u2019t do any project that does not result in an improvement of at least an order of magnitude.\u201d I felt smaller than a graduate student who could not answer a simple question. In that moment, I resolved to meet Asim\u2019s challenge. It took me until 2017 to do so. At the time, we were implementing an early version of CareView, which retrieves selected information relevant to a given clinical problem from the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC) and makes it available directly within the Cerner system. Clinicians traditionally accessed that information through CareWeb, a Web-based viewer for all of a patient\u2019s information in the INPC. For the six data elements highly relevant to chest pain, that took about 3-4 min. and 60 clicks. Today, it takes less than a second and two clicks to display this information in CareView. As of this writing, CareView supports seven chief complaints, and we are working on scaling it up to 100s and 1,000s of chief complaints. 2. Make a difference in practice: Starting with programming software for forestry operations that I developed for my dad as a teenager, my work has always had a very practical focus. I try not to do any projects which, either in the short or long term, will not make a difference in practice. Thus, almost all of my current research projects are resulting in applications or interventions that are implemented in routine, operational settings. While this makes doing research much harder than just producing papers, it is also a lot more impactful and rewarding. 3. Educate the next generation: Throughout my career, I have focused on developing the next generation of researchers and practitioners in informatics. While I always taught or mentored dental, computer science and other students and interns, one of the most effective ways of training and encouraging the next generation was through graduate and postgraduate informatics training supported by the NLM/NIDCR. From 1996 to 2015, I had uninterrupted funding for this program, a tradition that I continued with the founding of the NLM- funded Public and Population Health Informatics Training Program at Indiana University/the Regenstrief Institute. Today, this program trains a cadre of emerging leaders in public and population health informatics. My life and work in informatics have been, for me, the best choices I could have made. I get to work on interesting problems, improve people\u2019s lives and interact with lots of smart people from many different disciplines. I am hoping you (get to) feel the same way about informatics as I do! ", "David Shires": "IMIA president, 1980-1983 Professor of Family Medicine and Community Health & Epidemiology (Rtd.), Dalhousie University I was born in the beautiful city of Cape Town, South Africa many more years ago than I care to think about. I attended D. Shires, MD, MPH Rondebosch Boys High School (same school as Alan MacLeod Cormack, the Nobel prize winner for inventing the CAT-scan). All my life I wanted to be a doctor, but my family\u2019s financial status was insufficient to pay the costs that would entail. Nevertheless, I pursued my dream against overwhelming odds, having to beg, borrow, and scrounge up scholarships to graduate in 1960 from the University of Cape Town Medical School. Interning in the Children\u2019s hospital at the height of the summer diarrhea season, I worked 30-hour shifts placing delicate IV needles into infants\u2019 scalp veins to the point where I could do the procedure in my sleep, which I am sure must have occurred in reality many times! I had a spell as a goldmine doctor after that, until the tragic events of Sharpeville in 1962 convinced me that a bloodbath war in the country was inevitable. Fortunately, 40 years later, the efforts of Nobel Prize winners Mandela and de Klerk avoided that. In that same year of 1962, I boarded the mail ship (Southern Cross) to seek fame and fortune in London. Working as a pathology resident at St. Peter\u2019s Hospital in Chertsey (an outpost of St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital in London), I met many interesting people from the close-by film industry as well as from \u201cThommy\u2019s.\u201d Answering an advert in the British Medical Journal, I was interviewed in a London pub for a pathology residency at Tufts University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Arriving in the USA was a challenge, but I had many great tutors, one of whom not only taught me pathology but also kindled my great love of Mozart. From there I later proceeded to the University of Texas MD Anderson Hospital in Houston as a Postdoctoral Fellow, where I won the Fellows\u2019 Research prize. But for me my career in pathology was over, as I had developed a severe allergy to formaldehyde in 1965. It was in hematology that I had my first experience with medical informatics. Using the biomathematics department\u2019s CDC 3200 computer, I learned to write a simple Fortran program on punch cards to produce a spreadsheet of laboratory results for a week in one ward. I then took the printed output and placed them on the patients charts and sat back to await the applause for my efforts. It never came, and I learned the lesson that human perception and acceptance of radical new ideas like the introduction of medical informatics was not a problem of science but a problem of social and mental change and acceptance by the medical and broader health community. This was later identified to me by a Norwegian colleague as the \u201cYeah-but syndrome.\u201d Shortly thereafter I was approached by Tate Minckler who had spent time at the NIH, freezing cancer tissue for later study. Realizing that the cryology issues were not the problem but that the storage and retrieval of the data was woefully lacking, he developed the \u201cWho, What, When\u201d Medata computer storage and retrieval system, which was later contracted by NASA for the Apollo astronaut medical records. In 1967 I joined his project, which spun off several other Medical Informatics projects for laboratory automation. This gave me the chance to visit and meet with many US leaders developing computer systems in  health projects including those in Missouri (Don Lindberg), San Francisco (Morrie Collen), Buffalo, Boston, and Gainesville. I left Houston in 1969 to join the faculty of a new medical school at McMaster University in Canada. Continuing my fascination with medical informatics I visited many of the big names in Europe (Fran\u00e7ois Gr\u00e9my, Peter Reichertz, etc.) In Stockholm I went to the Karolinska Eye Department to see Hans Peterson, but he was not there (it wasn\u2019t Monday). One of the projects during those years involved the assistance to the China Computer Society in developing a computer system for community health records and merging traditional Chinese medicine with Western medicine. This stimulated my interest in international health development in Asia and Africa involving projects not always related to Medical Informatics. It was at that time that I became aware of IFIP TC4 (later IMIA), when I was approached by Jan Roukens to work with COACH (Canadian Health Informatics) and plan the second Medinfo in Toronto for 1977. Apparently I did well enough that, after the sudden, unexpected death of Jan van Eckberg while I was pursuing a master\u2019s degree at Harvard, I was asked to be the next TC4 secretary. My main activity at that time was negotiating the transition of IFIP TC4 to an independent IMIA with all the financial obligations that entailed. Unfortunately, this also included addressing the embezzlement of IMIA funds by an employee. When Jan Roukens gave up the chairmanship of TC4 in 1979, Hans Peterson and I were asked to stand as candidates to be the first elected president of the newly formed IMIA in 1980. While the members debated the choice, Hans and I took the time to develop a friendship which would last for the next 40 years. It was a surprise to me when the members elected me to be the first IMIA president with Hans as President-elect. Most of my activities as IMIA president related to encouraging developing countries to participate in the work of IMIA through regional associations. In this endeavour, I recall my friend Otto Rienhoff played a major part particularly in African countries. A few reminiscences of that time over 45 years ago: The pleasure of the friendship of so many IMIA people, Marion Ball, Barry Barber, Jan Roukens, Don Lindberg (who gave Shigekoto Kaihara his nickname \u201cKai\u201d in the back of a taxicab on the way to have dinner at Fran\u00e7ois Gr\u00e9my\u2019s home in Paris) and many more people I have regrettably failed to name, but thank you all. The support of Jan van Bemmel through many trying times; the joy of working with the long time Argentinian member Valerio Y\u00e1cubson to form IMIA-LAC, inaugurated in Mexico City underneath the Diego Rivera mural at the Hotel del Prado. Working with Roger Cote to obtain IMIA support for SnoMed to be accepted as the International Nomenclature of Disease. Meeting Kathy Hannah in Atlanta while she was doing a master\u2019s degree and encouraging her to actively pursue her career in nursing informatics by co-chairing one of the first Nursing Informatics seminars at the Tokyo Medinfo \u201980. The humor of Hans Peterson, exemplified when he and I and Bud Abbot were at Prague airport\u2014a small aircraft passed by the window which Bud could not see, and I asked Hans if he had any medical advice, to which he responded, \u201conly a white cane.\u201d The friendship of Don Lindberg both in IMIA and during his tenure as Director of the National Library of Medicine where I was fortuitously introduced to \u201cGrateful Med,\u201d the first medical literature retrieval system, of which I was probably one of the very first clients. Finally, at Medinfo \u201995 in Vancouver, I had the pleasure of meeting Elaine, the daughter of Steve Huesing, the administrator of the conference. Steve had to leave for an emergency and Elaine took over, with my encouragement and support, first demonstrating her administrative skills which 25 years later took her to the position in IMIA she now holds as Executive Director.  I have been humbled by the several honors bestowed upon me since my election as IMIA president\u2014the IFIP Silver Core Award, honorary Fellowships of IMIA and the British Computer Society, Fellowship in the American College of Medical Informatics, and a Lifetime Membership of COACH. I am most proud of all of them. Retiring from medical practice at Texas Tech University in 1997, my wife and I participated in developing and running a homeless shelter in Corpus Christi and a free dispensary in Angelfire, New Mexico, where we had a summer home. I now live happily with my wife in a resort area high in the Rocky Mountains of Western Colorado. ", "Ted Shortliffe": "Adjunct Professor of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia and Arizona Edward H. Shortliffe, MD, PhD, MACP, FACMI State Universities (current) Professor of Biomedical Informatics at Stanford (1979-2000), Columbia (2000-2007) and Arizona State Universities (2007-2018) Professor of Medicine, Stanford University (1979-2000) President and CEO, AMIA (2009-2012) Editor-in-Chief, Journal of Biomedical Informatics (2001-2020) Editor, Biomedical Informatics (textbook), 5 editions since 1990 I was born in Western Canada (Edmonton, Alberta) where my father was a newly trained physician and my E.H. Shortliffe, MD, PhD, mother a high school English teacher. After my father obtained additional training in healthcare administration at MACP, FACMI the University of Toronto (while the rest of the family stayed in Edmonton and I started first grade), Dad was recruited to a position at Hartford Hospital in Connecticut and we all moved to the US in 1954 and became citizens in the early 1960s. It was natural that I would be drawn to medicine. An annual ritual was Dad\u2019s visit to the hospital wards in Hartford on Christmas Day, where he would greet the staff members who were working on the holiday. I frequently joined him on these visits and remember being excited by the healthcare environment and impressed by the dedication of the physicians, house staff, nurses, and support staff who were working in good spirits on a major holiday. By the time I served as a hospital volunteer in high school (I attended a prep school near Hartford now known as Loomis-Chaffee), I was sure that I would pursue a career in medicine. I headed to Harvard College in 1966 (after a year as an exchange student in the UK from 1965-66) and, since Harvard did not offer a pre-med major, leveraged my interest in math and science to declare as a physics major. But then I discovered computers (which in those days were not yet available in the home or even in high school). I quickly learned that my interest in computer science eclipsed my interest in physics, and I took as many computer courses as I could while still meeting my other course distribution requirements. Since there was no Harvard computer science department or major at that time, I changed my undergraduate major to applied mathematics, which would allow me to take more computing classes. All this led to my realization that I had a tough decision: pursue medical school as I had planned for years, or apply to graduate school in computer science. The problem was that I could not decide and really wanted to do both. It was my undergraduate advisor, William Bossert, who knew about the Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS) at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and suggested that I make contact with the LCS director, Dr Octo Barnett, to see if I could get a student programming position and learn about what was happening at the intersection of medicine and computer science. To this day I wonder what would have happened if I had not received this advice! At MGH in 1968 I met with Octo Barnett, who was engaged with others in the development of the MUMPS programming language, with many application systems being implemented for the hospital. He gave me a programming test that required me to learn MUMPS quickly and then to plot (on an all-caps Model 33 teletype!) a blood pressure curve for a patient, based on systolic and diastolic pressures stored in a MUMPS  database. I must have passed this test adequately since he then agreed to give me a part- time programming position and assigned me to work on the doctoral research project of a young physician who had recently graduated from Harvard Medical School and was now doing a PhD dissertation project that was, essentially, an electronic medical record system for the MGH hypertension clinic. Thus began my longstanding personal and professional relationship with Dr. Robert Greenes, who was among the first two or three physicians to get doctoral training in computer science. I worked closely with Bob for two years and was thrilled when he acknowledged me by name when he published a New England Journal of Medicine paper on his system. Having become committed to continuing in both medicine and computer science, I needed to find a medical school that would allow me to pursue both types of courses \u2013 hopefully simultaneously. In 1970 this was a distinctly unusual idea, and many schools questioned why I would even want to study both fields. I also applied to Medical Scientist Training Programs (MSTP) at several schools, since they were designed to train MD/PhDs and at least some of the programs were willing to consider PhD training in engineering disciplines rather than traditional wet-bench fields. Although I was accepted into MSTP programs at several schools (notably Yale and Washington University St Louis), I ultimately decided to accept the medical school offer at Stanford University. They did not entertain MSTP applications until a student was already in the first year of medical school, so I took a chance in turning down other programs to go to a school where my MSTP acceptance was not guaranteed. However, Stanford had a great appeal. First, it offered remarkable flexibility in how one could get MD training \u2013 notably a sole requirement that a student pass all individual sections of the National Board Exam (Part 1) at the end of the second year (and Part 2 after clerkships). There was no required classroom curriculum and students could in theory elect to skip a course if they could pass the boards in that field through self-study. Furthermore, the medical school was literally across the street from engineering and computer science, and the university classes and medical school classes were on the same schedule. This meant I could hop on a bicycle and move between medical school and computer science classes without difficulty. In addition, the computing industry was evolving quickly in the Stanford area, with Hewlett Packard and the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) dominating at that time (although the \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d phrase had not yet been coined). So I took a chance, went to Stanford, and immediately started taking some computer science classes while I was a medical student. The first one was \u201cComputers and Thought\u201d, which intrigued me because it seemed inherently to combine the medical and computing fields. Little did I know that this course would change the direction of my career; it was an introductory course in artificial intelligence, which fascinated me and helped to define my own subsequent research interests. Of course I mostly took med school courses, and I got a programming position on a clinical computing project directed by our then-chief of clinical pharmacology, Dr. Stanley Cohen. Stan was a physician scientist whose work in genetics ultimately led to the famous Cohen-Boyer patent for gene splicing, and Stan went on to become the Chair of Genetics. But at this time he was still clinically active and he sponsored my application for the Stanford MSTP program, arguing cogently that medical computing, properly pursued, could be as scientific as the traditional bench sciences that dominated in the medical school at that time. Also influential was our Chair of Genetics, Joshua Lederberg, already a Nobel Laureate in Medicine, who supported advanced computing and ultimately brought the NIH SUMEX- AIM computer system to Stanford, which was the technical base for my own dissertation  work on the MYCIN system. I completed medical school courses in the first two years, passed my boards, and then did research work with Stan Cohen as my dissertation advisor. My PhD was completed in October 1975 and my MD in 1976. Also a crucial contributor to my work, and a friend and colleague to this day, was Dr. Bruce Buchanan, a research scientist in the computer science department who had been recruited to Stanford by Josh Lederberg and computer scientist Edward Feigenbaum. Subsequently I did an internship in medicine back at MGH, returned to Stanford for junior and senior residency, and then joined the Stanford faculty in internal medicine in 1979. By 1982 I had started a graduate training program for both MS and PhD students, fashioned after the informatics curriculum that I had devised for my own PhD. That program was supported by an NLM training grant starting in 1984 and continues to the present. It started under the name \u201cmedical information sciences\u201d but, as the informatics term was popularized and the biological applications of the field became prevalent, today it is known as \u201cbiomedical informatics\u201d. During my 21 years on the Stanford faculty, I continued an active research program focused on decision-support systems and AI. The rapid changes in computing technology presented us with processing, display, and interactive capabilities that would have been unthinkable when I began in the field. Accordingly, our work on Oncocin, T-Helper, and InterMed all explored the evolving technologies (graphical workstations and LISP machines, the commercialization of the Internet, touch screen tablets, and local area networking) while focusing on developing new types of usable and acceptable interactive systems to assist with clinical decision making. This was also the period when a number of young and adventurous students came to Stanford to get informatics graduate degrees. They all had a pioneering spirit and commitment to the field, since the discipline was new, largely unrecognized in the broader medical community, and focused on future potential more than on current commercial systems. The passion of those students, coupled with their intellect and creativity, led to a marvelous intellectual environment, and I often look back and observe that the training we offered, and the students that we attracted, likely constituted a greater contribution to the field than did any of the individual research projects that we undertook. Many of those trainees are now well-known leaders in the field, and they are scattered around the country and internationally. I assumed the PI-ship of the SUMEX-AIM resource for several years and collaborated with colleagues to create and fund successfully a follow-on resource known as the Center for Advanced Medical Informatics at Stanford (CAMIS). With additional responsibilities in the Stanford dean\u2019s office, where I oversaw computing resources for the medical school, and my duties as Chief of General Internal Medicine in the Department of Medicine, this was a particularly busy period. My time for research work was too often compromised by all the other work I was doing, some of which was on the national scene rather than at Stanford itself. I started the new century by accepting a position as Chair of the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University\u2019s College of Physicians and Surgeons. This also allowed me to return to my roots on the East coast, where I have thoroughly enjoyed my new home base in Manhattan. We redesigned the training program there and attracted another cadre of superb students, many of whom are now well-known informatics leaders. Unlike the Stanford program, the program at Columbia had faculty who were deeply involved with the day-to-day creation and management of clinical systems, working closely with the hospital and outpatient clinic information technology groups. This allowed me to get more involved with hospital systems and their strategic  planning. Also while I was at Columbia, I was enticed to take over as Editor-in-Chief of the former Computers and Biomedical Research, which we rebranded as the Journal of Biomedical Informatics. That journal focuses on papers that introduce novel generalizable informatics methodologies. It is recognized as among the top journals in th the field and we are celebrating its 20 anniversary in 2020. I did take a break from New York from 2007-2009 (when I was founding dean of the new Phoenix campus of the University of Arizona College of Medicine, with a cross appointment at Arizona State University\u2014ASU) and from 2009-2012 (when I followed Don Detmer as the second full-time President and CEO of the American Medical Informatics Association). Since then I have Donald A.B. Lindberg and Ted Shortlife in 1983 at the Aiguille returned to New York and, avoiding the notion of retirement, du Midi (3842m) cable-car station beneath the peak of Mont- Blanc have taken adjunct teaching appointments at both Columbia and ASU while editing the th journal and my textbook of Biomedical Informatics, soon to be released in its 5 edition. I am an advisor on several boards, have been active at the National Academy of Medicine (where I have led several studies over the years), do some consulting to industry, and travel extensively to give talks and visit informatics programs around the world. Dating my entry into the field to 1968 at MGH, I now look back on over a half- century participating in the evolution of biomedical informatics as a young discipline and as an applied field that is now being widely embraced in academia, health care, and the health information technology industry. There is still much to be done, and one worries about some of the hype that one hears about the field and its presumed short- term impact (especially in the areas of AI and machine learning), but it has been a wonderful ride and, in the years ahead, I will enjoy continuing to watch and participate in the field\u2019s progress and support for health and health care. ", "Elliot R. Siegel": "Associate Director for Health Information Programs Development (Ret.) U.S. National Library of Medicine Scientific Executive (Ret.) National Institutes of Health A Medical Informatics Odyssey (a poem) IT was 1976, the US Bicentennial Year, electronic decision support systems were bursting forth everywhere. The Myers, Millers, Kulikowskis, Shortliffes, and Weeds, all visionary leaders in that day and prolific in their deeds. NLM\u2019s innovation was literature-based, of course, a traditional Gastro textbook at its core extracting new content from Medline papers would prove to be a significant updating chore. Enter Siegel from a social science domain quite foreign to medicine, bringing communication research and industrial psychology as the needed skill-set regimen. He devised with Schoolman and Bernstein the Hepatitis Knowledge Base prototype, adapted Turoff\u2019s experimental email system for expert communication when updates were ripe. Although the early promise of AI was not fully realized, all was not for naught in its stead we have mobile computing, Google search, and imperfect commercial clinical support. In 1984, my journey took a significant turn and one without end, the arrival of Don Lindberg an amazing informatics pioneer destined to become my mentor and friend. Lindberg launched a strategic planning initiative that discovered new essentials, among them genomic databases, visible humans, and unconnected health professionals. I managed the planning process, but Lindberg was key, bringing in a huge number of friends, including G.O.B, Alvy Ray Smith and Mike DeBakey. The plans drove the NLM budget we liked to say, and left a huge footprint for academic research and training programs mapping their own way. With Lindberg came IMIA and new international relations, abetted by the likes of Ball, Piemme, Collen and van Bemmel a never-ending gala of parties and papers ranked Medinfo 86 atop all Washington sensations. G7 came calling and with Ackerman and Wood we tackled global healthcare forthwith, making Internet performance measurement the indisputable proof  when America slept Europe consumed most of the limited bandwidth. Our Internet connectivity work became known far and wide, with Royall we built a satellite communications network for Varmus\u2019 NIH, WHO, and Wellcome enabling sub-Saharan African malaria researchers to stem that disease tide. Al Gore invented the Internet so he would claim, built on the labors of Cerf and Kahn and many too numerous to name. Lindberg and Masys part of a Fed action team with the promise of money and no worry, we helped transform an obscure NREN into a commercial success and an engine for discovery. Internet would henceforth become the preferred means for searching NLM databases, a policy edict affecting the International Medlars Centers and all others an essential first step towards near universal cost-free access to information services. Outreach to individual health professionals became a reality even on the American frontier, but there remained the need of serving the public\u2014and our family and friends we all hold dear. Underrepresented minorities especially lacked connectivity and knowledge, unaware of trusted health information resources like our own MedlinePlus we targeted them in adulthood, high school and preparing for college.

", "Daniel Sigulem": "Full Professor, Paulista School of Medicine, Federal Univ. of S\u00e3o Paulo Specialist in Nephrology (Ph.D.) and Clinical Medicine (M.D.) Professor and Founder, Department of Health Informatics Paulista School of Medicine, Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo Former President of the Brazilian Society of Health Informatics For Christmas 1983, I received the present of a black box that connected to my television and was called a TK82. This computer, with approximately 16 Kbytes of memory, when connected to a tape deck, was able to store routines developed in the programming language Basic. After many attempts, however, I discovered that the black box was a scam \u2013 rather, it didn't work at all! So, in early 1984, I instead bought an IBM PC microcomputer, which had 64 Kbytes of memory, a green phosphor monitor and an outlet for a tape player. With this equipment, it was possible to program some lines in Basic record them on tapes with the results appearing on screen. I learned to program in dBase and to develop databases, one for hypertension and the other for nutrition. This emerging passion of mine for computer-related work coincided with my developing an allergy to rat hair and albumin, and it led me to shift my research away from laboratory activities, and getting increasingly closer to information technology as applied to healthcare. In Brazil, the first steps in health informatics were taken by Dr. Roberto Jaime Rodrigues. He hailed from the Advanced Studies Program in Hospital Administration and Healthcare Systems at the Clinical Hospital of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo and from the S\u00e3o Paulo School of Business Administration of the Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation. Together with the Pan American Health Organization, in 1986 he organized a Pan-American Traveling Seminar with the goal of sponsoring professionals from Latin America to attend the Fifth World Congress on Medical Informatics (MEDINFO\u201986), in Washington, D.C., and to participate in the workshop on the \u201cInternational Collaboration on the Application of Medical Informatics\u201d. In addition the participants were to also familiarize themselves with other health informatics research institutions, and especially the US National Library of Medicine (NLM). The workshop took place on 23\u201324 October, 1986 at the NLM, and was attended by 22 members of the Traveling Seminar and 24 other guests. I found it to be an incredible experience. After these intense contacts, in which Brazilian professionals had the opportunity to hear and to discuss the latest developments in the field with the most renowned experts in Health Informatics from around the world, it became clear that there was an urgent need to establish a Brazilian Society of Health Informatics. Fortunately this came about shortly afterwards, in November 1986, during the first Brazilian Congress on Health Informatics (ICBIS) held in Campinas, and funded by the National Council of Research, through its life sciences division coordinator Dr. Reginaldo Albuquerque. The founding of the Brazilian Society for Informatics in Healthcare (abbreviated SBIS in Portuguese), had the support of Drs. Beatriz Faria Le\u00e3o and Mariza Kluck from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, from Dr. Miguel Nicolelis representing the medical specialty of Pathology from the State University of S\u00e3o Paulo, at the time directed by Prof. Dr. Gyorgy Bohm, and from Dr. Renato Sabbatini, from the neurosciences at the State University of Campinas, as well as myself, specializing in nephrology, representing the Paulista School of Medicine (EPM). As  result, several colleagues approached me, seeing that my field of nephrology was helping define promising directions in informatics, and developed other lines of investigation such as the management of systems for databases, and health education through computers and artificial intelligence. With Monica Parente Ramos, from biomedical engineering, we developed a project in image processing within the Radioisotope Section of EPM and began to work more generally on Artificial Intelligence applied to Health. Encouraged by Dr. Beatriz de Faria Le\u00e3o from the Cardiology Institute of Rio Grande do Sul who started her doctoral work on the acquisition and representation of expert knowledge in the field of congenital defects in cardiology. This was encouraged and defended as a doctoral thesis at the Cardiology Department of EPM. As result it was decided to hold a 1st Artificial Intelligence Seminar in Medicine in our School of Medicine, which took place in May 1987 with more than 60 professionals from all over the country attending, including a majority of professionals in the country who were developing project in Artificial Intelligence applied to Healthcare. The success of this event led to the creation of a Center for Medical Informatics for the National Center for Investigations (CNPq) with the EPM, including myself from Nephrology and professor Dr. Armando Freitas da Rocha, from the Department of Physiology at UNICAMP, and Dr. Fabio Gandour, the Director of the Data Processing Center of the Ministry of Health, we became the first visiting professors at this Center. Later we were joined by professors H\u00e9lio Menezes Silva and Pedro S\u00e9rgio Nicolletti from Artificial Intelligence, in the Department of Computing of the Federal University of Campina Grande (Para\u00edba), who spent a month in my Department of Nephrology, introducing us to Artificial Intelligence and helping to guide the creation of this new research area. In 1988, the UNIFESP Health Informatics Center became a reality and started its activities under my coordination. In October 1987, in Porto Alegre, Drs. Beatriz de Faria Le\u00e3o and Mariza Kluck Stumpf organized SIS 87 \u2013 the Brazilian Seminar on Health Informatics with the 1st Technical Exhibition in the field. Several foreign researchers were invited and, in recognition of the activities developed in the country, SBIS became a member of IMIA. Aware of the very large gap in this field between the Brazilian experience and those of developed countries, researchers from all over Brazil planned and gathered ideas and materials. stimulated by the director of one of the country's research agencies \u2013 the National Council for Technological Development \u2013 CNPq. The Center began to distribute activities, and develop projects in the area of health informatics in own their institutions. At the Health Informatics Center of UNIFESP, at the time, research and development teams were organized in the areas of: 1. teaching: responsible for the coordination and organization of lectures, and extracurricular courses, training in computer labs, curricular courses and help- desk; 2. research and development of applications and systems: program teams for education; computer systems team; support systems team for decision making; and distributed systems team; 3. computer network: responsible for the implementation, maintenance and support of the computer network of the university complex and its university hospital \u2013 the Hospital S\u00e3o Paulo. On June 22, 1999, after 10 years of activities, the Computer Center for Healthcare was officially turned into an Academic Department, becoming the first such in the country, consolidating its missions of teaching and research. The Department now includes 6 higher education disciplines, in addition to specializations. In 2001, the  Postgraduate Program in Health Informatics was approved at the University and in the following year, it was approved by the Federal agency for Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) at the academic master and doctoral levels, starting in 2003. I coordinated this program until 2009, when we combined two research areas with similar objectives to join forces and unify research: Health Management and Economics and Health Informatics. The trained professionals, masters and doctors, were and continue to be responsible for the implementation of health informatics disciplines in other health institutions of research and teaching, as well as being involved in government and private sector activities. In 2009 a new postgraduate program was started: Management and Informatics in Healthcare, coordinated by Professor Dr. Heimar de F\u00e1tima Marin until 2016. The Department currently has 11 faculty members and involves the following research areas: \u2212 Acquisition and analysis of biological data and medical images \u2212 Management and analysis of technologies \u2212 Health data registration, retrieval and their relationships \u2212 Educational technologies \u2212 Modeling of biological systems The Postgraduate Program in Management and Health Informatics now in 2020 has thirteen supervising teachers, 26 students enrolled in the master's and 9 in the doctoral programs, distributed over 4 projects. In conclusion, I can say that the consolidation of Health Informatics in Brazil is the fruitful outcome of the very intense collaborations among the many leading professionals in the country mentioned above. ", "Dean F. Sittig": "Professor, School of Biomedical Informatics University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston Executive Director, CIRCLEinformatics.org Fellow, American College of Medical Informatics Fellow, International Academy of Health Sciences Informatics My research career has been filled with many seemingly unconnected twists and turns. While I cannot honestly say that all were the result of a pre-existing grand clinical informatics vision, in hindsight I am able to bring some coherence to them and provide some insight into where the field might go from here. This coherence derives from a socio-technical model of the broad field of clinical informatics, recently developed by Hardeep Singh and me, which we refer to as \u201cthe 8 rights model\u201d of safe and effective health information technology design, development, implementation, and use. This 8-dimension, recursive framework identifies and describes key components of safe and effective health information and communication technology. The 8-Rights Model of Safe Health Information Technology 1. Right System \u2013 Hardware and software must be capable of supporting the clinical activities. It must be fast, reliable, and appropriately protected to ensure the safety, privacy, and integrity of the clinical and administrative data it contains. 2. Right Content \u2013 EMR vocabulary used to encode the clinical findings, enter orders, and store laboratory results must be standardized and used to encode all data. The clinical knowledge that forms the basis of the clinical decision support must be evidence-based and appropriate for the user\u2019s practice as well as periodically updated. 3. Right Human-Computer User Interface \u2013 The EMR\u2019s user interface must be user-friendly: easy to learn and use. The interface should improve situation awareness by presenting all the relevant patient data in a format that allows the clinicians to rapidly perceive and assess the problem, formulate a response, and document his/her actions. 4. Right People \u2013 Users must be appropriately trained, re-trained and interact closely with the informatics experts and application coordinators to design and maintain the systems. 5. Right Workflow / Communication \u2013 the EMR must fit into the workflow of the clinic or hospital and enhance communication between users who often practice in time pressured settings. 6. Right Organizational Policies, Procedures, and Environment \u2013 the organization must make adjustments to previous policies, procedures, organizational culture, and physical environment or establish new ones that account for EMR use. 7. Right State and Federal Rules and Regulations \u2013 both the Local and National governments must work to create the appropriate regulatory environment to enable these systems to evolve while maintaining appropriate safety and privacy oversight. 8. Right Monitoring -- organizations or users must continually evaluate the performance of EMRs through robust, monitoring systems and test if automated processes are working correctly, efficiently, safely, and as expected. The model posits that for safe and effective health information technology use to occur, one must successfully address each of the eight dimensions of the model. My research career can be seen as a lifelong exploration of the many inter-related aspects of this model, looking forward in some of these areas, but also overcoming obstacles in one or more dimensions of the model. More often than not, I dove-in head first and began  addressing them, which may have violated a cardinal rule of academic research, namely focus and specialize, but this has allowed me to leverage my natural curiosity and ability to quickly learn new techniques and procedures, with the ultimate goal of exploring how computers and computational techniques can improve the quality and safety of the healthcare delivery system and eventually human health and well-being. I began my academic career at The Pennsylvania State University (PSU) in the Biomedical Engineering department, working in the Noll Laboratory for Human Performance Research on projects using the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP- 11 minicomputer to automatically collect data, using analog-digital converters from existing laboratory equipment and modeling physiologic processes. My master\u2019s thesis involved a software model explaining how bottled-oxygen respirators used by miners in underground disasters, worked: at the \u201chardware and software\u201d levels of the 8-rights model. Toward the end of my studies, I realized that both I, and the computer systems, had to incorporate significantly more clinical knowledge if they were to effectively support researchers, clinicians, healthcare delivery systems, and eventually patients. To get closer to the clinical environment was my passion, though I realized early on, that becoming a physician was not an option as I do not like being around sick people! So I pursued a PhD at the University of Utah and worked on a range of projects at the LDS Hospital: evaluation of the effect of charting on nursing work patterns and refinement of the Apache physiologic scoring system, under the informatics mentorship of Reed M. Gardner, Homer R. Warner, and Dwayne R. Westenskow and clinical mentors Alan Morris and Terry P. Clemmer. This culminated in the design, development, and testing of an expert system to help physicians manage the ventilator settings of severely ill patients with Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome. This was my PhD work, winning the Martin Epstein Best Student Paper Award at the 1987 SCAMC. Most of my work in Utah focused on the \u201ccontent\u201d level of the 8-rights model. Next I worked as an assistant professor with Perry L. Miller, an anesthesiologist and computer science PhD at the Yale School of Medicine, and an insightful expert in the theoretical aspects of artificial intelligence in medicine. While there I worked with David H. Gelernter and Michael Factor exploring parallel computation in biology and medicine, including the design and development of an intelligent cardiovascular monitor on one of the (at the time) large (64-node) parallel computers, again focusing on the hardware and software levels of the 8-rights model. Realizing that many factors beyond hardware and software limited our ability to truly transform the process of healthcare I then moved to Vanderbilt to join the new clinical information system and informatics program there. At Vanderbilt I worked with William W. Stead, becoming immersed in the day-to-day operations of the medical center as we struggled to design and develop the infrastructure required to implement a state-of-the-art clinical information system across the medical center. It involved design and implementation of a fiber-optic backbone network, selection and implementation of a commercial hospital information system (SMS), establishing an academic medical informatics department, starting the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, and participating in a medical center-wide \u201cdesign team\u201d. During this 9-month design team process we had to identify what was working and what was not across the medical center and recommend fixes. This made me fully realize the importance and range of diversity of people involved in the delivery of healthcare in a modern healthcare environment. While obvious in retrospect, I also realized that the clinical information systems that we were about to implement did not even come close to addressing the myriad clinical needs. To begin addressing these issues \u2013 at the people and work flow levels of the 8-rights model \u2013 I eventually moved  to Harvard and the Brigham & Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, but not before enjoying a \u201conce-in-a-life\u201d opportunity to work as part of the US Universities \u2013 Saudi Arabian project at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. As a clinical information architect on this project, I worked with Soumitra Sengupta (a computer scientist from Columbia University) and was involved in the implementation and governance of the first \u201cofficial\u201d internet connection within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the development of a requirements document for their first clinical information system, and the first internet-accessible, medical journal (The Annals of Saudi Medicine). Most of my work was on the \u201corganizational policy and procedure\u201d and \u201cExternal Regulatory\u201d levels of the 8-rights model. Beyond developing key negotiation and design skills, I was able to experience a unique culture firsthand. This was an opportunity I will always be thankful for and never forget. Upon returning to the US, I worked on next-generation clinical information system design and development projects at the Brigham & Women\u2019s Hospital and its successor Partners Healthcare System, where, in the Clinical Information Systems Research and Development group I worked with Jonathan M. Teich, David W. Bates, Tejal Gandhi, and Gilad J. Kuperman. Acting as an internal research, development, and consulting group we identified research needs, created proposals, and presented these concepts to the administration. I led major research and development efforts, including: a) a new Clinical Application Suite, an integrated software architecture that facilitated the maintenance of the patient and user context as users switched between applications. It was the first working version of what is now known as the HL-7 Clinical Context Object Workgroup\u2019s (CCOW) standard - a key component of the software architecture of the Partners\u2019 clinical applications and b) an out-patient clinical referral application that facilitated: identifying an appropriate specialist; collecting the clinical, demographic, and financial data required to generate a referral; and transferring the information between the specialist and the primary care physician (PCP). As lead informatics expert, I also worked on an enterprise-wide clinical data repository; a separate research data repository (which subsequently became the I2B2 open-source data warehousing platform); an enterprise-wide master patient index; a critical review of web-based interfaces to clinical information systems; a clinical software developers\u2019 guide for graphical user interface design; and a system to help nurses develop interactive order sets. In 1999, at the height of the Internet-boom, an opportunity to join an Internet-startup focusing on healthcare, looked to be too good to be true\u2026Unfortunately, it was. In an informatics R&D group with Brian L. Hazlehurst, we designed, developed, and evaluated the clinical search functionality for the consumer website - a multi-million- dollar project with a team of scientists and engineers working in close collaboration. My role was to develop a functioning website based on the model for which WebMD was awarded two patents. It had the first integrated spell-checker and semantically-enhanced, clinically-focused advertising system based on the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), but corporate intellectual property constraints meant we could not publish this revolutionary work, which still forms the basis of the WebMD consumer search engine. I also worked on other cutting-edge clinical informatics projects including: conversion of the Scientific American Medicine textbook series into a computable format; integration of the clinical content from several small internet-start-ups with WebMD\u2019s vast clinical knowledge base using our UMLS integration engine; and development of a business case for WebMD\u2019s personal health record product. But, after only 18 months, when WebMD moved its Portland, OR office to Santa Clara, CA, my family and I decided that it was best to stay in Portland and pursue other opportunities.  This turned out rather well, when Kaiser Permanente\u2019s Center for Health Research hired our 3-person informatics R&D group. Besides working at Kaiser Permanente, Northwest (KPNW) as their Director of Applied Research in Medical Informatics, I reconnected to my academic roots as adjunct faculty at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) working with Joan S. Ash, widening my clinical informatics-related research and teaching opportunities. At Kaiser I helped develop the business case for purchasing a new nationwide EHR (Epic); design of a nationwide clinical data warehouse; clinical knowledge management infrastructure; internal clinical information resources website; a personal health record; and advanced clinical decision support (CDS) capabilities. Gradually shifting my focus to more academic research projects in KPNW\u2019s Center for Health Research (CHR) and OHSU\u2019s Medical Informatics department, I was a co-investigator on a large 4-year, multi-center clinical trial to test the utility of providing feedback to clinicians on performance in helping patients quit smoking; worked on a Natural Language Processing System that could identify whether physicians documented the provision of the 5A\u2019s (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) of smoking cessation counseling to their patients. This project bridged gaps between the hardware and software and content layers of the model, while also exploring the importance of measurement and monitoring. In addition, as the lead informatics investigator for a knowledge-based information retrieval system, our goal was to develop a system that could identify the most appropriate patient-specific educational material based on the information contained in the patient\u2019s electronic record. I also served as lead informatics investigator on a 2-year study of Epic for state-of- the-art clinical decision support to clinicians on medication management like drug-drug interactions and medications to avoid in the elderly. This bridged gaps between content, user interface, workflow, and organizational policies. In addition, I joined Joan Ash\u2019s qualitative research group, the Provider Order Entry Team (POET), resulting in a very productive collaboration yielding 3 NLM funded RO1\u2019s, 1 AHRQ contract, and a book entitled Clinical Information Systems: Overcoming Adverse Consequences. We explored the people, and organizational policies, procedures, culture, and environment and began developing the intellectual foundations of the 8-rights model at this time. In 2008, I heard from M. Michael Shabot and Eric J. Thomas, who were looking for faculty members to join their new Center for Healthcare Quality & Safety in Houston. I jumped at the opportunity, though I continued my research collaborations with Joan Ash at OHSU and with Blackford Middleton at Partners. Recently, I have developed excellent research collaborations with Hardeep Singh at the Houston VA focusing mainly on the \u201cWork flow and communications\u201d level of the 8-rights model and Adam Wright at Vanderbilt focusing on CDS. These collaborations lead to the development of the US Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC)\u2013endorsed \u201cSafety Assurance Factors for EHR Resilience\u201d (SAFER) guides. In addition, I worked with the Memorial Hermann Health System on their CDS to improve the specificity of their alerting system (mainly at the measurement and monitoring stage of the 8-rights model). If the field of clinical informatics is to continue making progress, we must focus on each of the 8-dimensions of our 8-Rights model of safe and effective use of health information technology. ", "Diane J. Skiba": "Professor Emeritus University of Colorado College of Nursing In 1979, I completed my PhD in Research Methods and Applied Statistics at the University of Virginia, focusing on statistical methodology and its role in research and program evaluation. In graduate school, I learned how to keypunch, program and create commands to analyze data. I will never forget the punch cards that I carried to the computer center. I D.J. Skiba, PhD, vividly remember how to read hexadecimal error codes. As a FACMI, ANEF, FAAN graduate student, I worked for Dr. Phyllis Veronick, a researcher that spent years trying to predict the occurrence of bedsores. She taught me a lot about data. She also knew her data and could visualize the correlations as she studied the data on the blackboard. I was always fearful that my analysis might not correspond to her predictions. When I finished my course work (including a Fortran course for my language competency!) I went to work as an assistant professor at Boston University. I did a lot of data analysis and even created a clinical log system for nurse practitioner students to document their clinical experiences. Our nurse practitioner students were in joint practice with residents at Boston City Hospital. I developed a form for them to complete after each patient encounter. I then faithfully entered all their data and would run summaries of their visits. I also analyzed a lot of data sets for others in the school of nursing. After completing my PhD, I purchased my first computer, an Apple II. My brother was a software designer and created a program called Micro Cookbook on the Apple. I developed two databases of tested recipes for desserts and appetizers with software programs for Micro Cookbook. My friends loved being invited to my house as they knew they would get to taste test my recipes. With these experiences, I decided to look at how computers might be used in nursing. I was fortunate to attend the National Institutes of Health\u2019s \u2018Computers and Nursing\u201d at the Clinical Center, organized by Dr. Virginia Saba. She immediately told me that I needed to attend the first nursing section at the Fifth Annual Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care (SCAMC). It was at this conference that I met Dr. Judith Ronald and Dr. Patricia Brennan. Dr. Ronald helped me to design the first course on computers in nursing that was offered at Boston University School of Nursing in 1983. I also got involved with the first nursing informatics special interest group (NISIG) that met at SCAMC. At subsequent SCAMC meetings, Dr. Saba asked me to serve as treasurer of the NISIG. While at Boston University, I had three memorable experiences that helped to shape my goal of ensuring that all nurses were prepared to use technology most effectively to assist in patient care. The first involved developing a pilot MS program that educated two graduate students (Barbara Paganelli and Jeanette Polaschek) in the field of informatics. Both have gone on to very successful careers in nursing informatics. Secondly, I organized two national conferences at my University that emphasized the importance of teaching nurses about technology. The conferences attracted over 300 nurses from across the country, and motivated our faculty to vote YES for the development and implementation of a course on Computers in Nursing. The third  involved a grant I received from IBM to establish a computer center within the school of nursing. We received 10 IBM PCs and printers to teach nurses about computers. This was quite an accomplishment given that the only other school that received such a grant was in engineering. I remember making the pitch\u2026..that nurses would SAVE lives if they had quick access to patient data to support clinical decisions. The marketing people liked the notion of SAVING lives. In 1986, with the pending closure of the Boston University\u2019s School of Nursing, I was recruited to teach in the first graduate nursing program at the University of Massachusetts Worcester Campus. In this program, we had joint appointments in education and practice. I worked with the Quality Department at the hospital and helped integrate informatics content into all graduate nursing courses. I also received a grant from Hewlett Packard to be part of their alpha testing of their physiological monitoring system that was designed by HP engineers and my former graduate, Barbara Paganelli. This was also the time when I attended my first IMIA Nursing Informatics international meeting. As I mentioned, I was extremely fortunate to have two early mentors, Drs. Judith Ronald and Virginia Saba, who brought me into the informatics community. I attended the Nursing Informatics International meetings in 1988 at the advice of Dr. Ronald. As one of the first educators to develop an undergraduate course on computers for nursing, she was actively involved with the IMIA NI-SIG since its inception and first meeting in London. Dr. Saba was instrumental in encouraging me to attend the NI-SIG General Assembly meetings as an observer. My experience at the Third International Symposium on Nursing Use of Computers and Information Science in Dublin was life-changing. The event opened my eyes to the wealth of informatics knowledge from across the world. I was pleasantly surprised to see how informatics permeated the practice of nursing in various countries around the globe. I particularly remember trying to get to every panel, poster and presentation. Of course, that was impossible given how many there were, but I was thrilled to get and read the proceedings. My biggest moment was an invitation to attend the post-conference on Decision Support Systems in Nursing. I remember being able to interact with many experts in the field. It was like being with the \u201cgreat ones\u201d. On the return flight to the US, I remember earmarking all the articles I would use in courses and share my new- found knowledge with clinicians, administrators and students. It was a very validating experience. In 1989, I was recruited by the University of Colorado College of Nursing to start an informatics MS program. I remember that in my interview, I discovered that secretaries were still using Wang Word Processors and only a handful of faculty, primarily researchers, had PCs. Over the years, I not only established an MS graduate informatics specialty but also served as the Associate Dean of Informatics and Director of Academic Innovations. During the 1997-1998 academic year, I transitioned our informatics program into an online program that allowed students to access it from across the United States and around the world. We are extremely proud to have graduates from Canada, the Middle East, Germany, Singapore and Thailand. Over the 28 years at the University, I have received numerous grants to not only prepare nursing informatics and other clinicians. We are proud of our funding by the Office of the National Coordinator of Health Information Technology to train Masters (MS) graduate students and to award informatics certificates to a variety of clinicians and other workers involved in health care such as diabetic educators, administrators and clinical lab technicians. The $2.6 million grant allows us to educate 15 MS and 156 certificate students per year. One of most exciting grants provided funding to start the Denver FreeNet. This was a foundation grant that allowed us to build an electronic bulletin board system using the  Cleveland FreeNet software. We were one of the only FreeNets operated by a School of Nursing. My inspiration for this project was Dr. Patricia Brennan\u2019s work with ComputerLink. This community computing system helped users become familiar with the various services in the Denver area and throughout Colorado, provided health care brochures and information, offered online support groups, free email, and was involved in many community projects. One such community project was to operate an online discussion that was available after a showing of a domestic violence program. This fostered many healthy discussions among participants from various neighborhoods across the greater Denver region. We also worked with the Colorado Library system to make the FreeNet accessible to all citizens of Colorado through 800 dial in modem numbers. I remember testimony before the State of Colorado Finance & Budget Committee to continue funding of free 800 phone numbers to allow citizens to participate in discussion and gain access to valuable information. Can you imagine, we were the talk of the campus while using only 9600 Baud modems! The grant allows us to experiment with citizen and patient engagement. I have attended every NI International conference except for one in Taiwan that I missed due to my journey with cancer. I have also been invited to the following post conferences: Informatics Competencies.13th International Congress on Nursing Informatics. Villars-sur-Ollon, Switzerland; The Art and Science of ICT Implementation, th Post Congress. 11 International Congress on Nursing Informatics. Saint-Sauveur, Canada; Personal Health Information Management: Tools and Strategies for Citizens' th Engagement. 10 International Conference on Nursing Informatics. Vanaja, Finland; th Accessing and Applying Evidence to Practice. 7 International Conference on Nursing Use of Computers and Information Science. Rotoruda, New Zealand and Health Care Information Technology: Implications for Change. 4th International Symposium on Nursing Use of Computers and Information Science. Sorrento, Australia. In IMIA- NISIG, I served as co-chair Education Taskforce with Dr. Michelle Honey from New Zealand, was honorary member in 2007, Scientific Program Committee Member for the th th 11 and 13 International Congress, Chair of the Student Awards (2003-2009), US Representative to IMIA NI 2012-2016, and Vice Chair for Membership of NI SIG in 2015. I am now Chair of the NI-SIG from 2016-2020. This is truly a highlight in my long career of informatics. I am truly fortunate to have great mentors and distinguished colleagues in nursing informatics from across the world. Their lifelong friendships have enabled me to achieve my original goal of ensuring that nurses are prepared to effectively use health information technologies for safe and quality patient care. I am proud to be an educator and director of the health care informatics online graduate program and my work to facilitate the use of digital tools to engage patients, families, and caregivers, as members of interprofessional care teams, to make their health care decisions. ", "Warner V. Slack (1933 \u2013 2018)": "I arrived at Princeton as an undergraduate in 1951\u2014an exciting time in that small New Jersey town. Albert Einstein had been recruited by Abraham Fleming to be the first professor in his Institute for Advanced Study, which although not formally related to the University, was close in proximity, intellectually as well as geographically. Among the other Institute luminaries was the great mathematician John von Neumann, whose innovative ideas about the digital computer, formulated in part with Alan Turing, engendered great excitement and great expectations. As a student bound for medical school, it occurred to me that the computer might have a role in clinical medicine. As a medical student at Columbia, I continued to think about the computer. Also, I found myself increasingly concerned about the paternalism in medicine\u2014\u201cgood\u201d patients were expected to \u201ccomply\u201d with doctors\u2019 \u201corders\u201d\u2014a paternalism that deprived the patient of the right to participate in medical decisions and deprived the doctor of what could be valuable help from the patient. During internship and neurology residency at the University of Wisconsin those thoughts in both areas began to take definite shape. With the guidance and support of mentors, such as John Cameron, in medical physics, Robert Schilling, in hematology and department of medicine chairman, and Frank Larson, in the clinical laboratories, I was granted a Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) fellowship to pursue my interest. For starters, I formulated my ideas about the computer as a means to collect and store information from the medical history, physical exam and clinical laboratories and then to use this information help with diagnosis and suggestions for therapy. Then I formulated a set of ideas about the patient\u2019s role in his or her own treatment. In the spirit of the progressive \u201860s I developed the term \u201cpatient power,\u201d arguing that patients who so wish should be welcomed as partners in the clinical transaction and respected for their right to participate in medical decisions, with their values taking precedence. Further, I argued that medical charts should be declassified, shared with patients, and, when appropriate, developed jointly by doctor and patient. During two years as a neurologist in the Air Force, I developed a self-administered pencil and paper medical history questionnaire, very helpful in our busy clinic, and found sharing my write-ups with patients helped to improve their accuracy. Back in Madison in 1964 to resume my fellowship, I put questions for patients on Hollerith cards, similar to Morris Collen\u2019s approach at Kaiser Permanente, but with additional question-laden cards to obtain details about the patients\u2019 problems; and used a Fortran program coded by Larry Van Cura for the University\u2019s Control Data 1604, to store patients\u2019 responses and print clinical summaries.  I had in mind that a computer might someday be available to interact directly with the patient, but it was Phil Hicks who suggested I use the Laboratory Instrument Computer (LINC) for my medical history programs. Phil was already using the LINC for his pioneering programs in the clinical laboratories. Wes Clark and Charlie Molnar at MIT had developed the LINC in the early 1960s\u2014a powerful, groundbreaking machine, in many respects the forerunner of the personal computer. Although designed primarily for the research laboratory, the LINC, with its cathode ray screen, keyboard, and teletype printer, turned out to be uniquely well-suited for patients to use. I hoped that with the help of careful writing, the computer might engage in meaningful dialogue and explore medical problems in detail, all in a personalized, dignified, and considerate manner. With Phil Hicks, Larry Van Cura, and our allergist colleague Charlie Reed, I developed a computer-based medical history program with a focus for starters on allergies, and a teletyped summary for printing, in a legible but otherwise traditional format. In addition to helping doctors care for patients, the computer I hoped, might be of interest to patients (perhaps even enjoyable), and in keeping with my premise that the largest, least well utilized health care resource was the patient or perspective patient, perhaps even encouraging and helping patients to help themselves with their medical problems. The program reinforced patient power by respecting patients\u2019 priorities and encouraging them to read their printed summaries and offer suggestions for improvement. The program also offered patients control over the conversation, with response options, such as \u201cDon\u2019t Know\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Understand\u201d, and later, \u201cRather Not Answer.\u201d Though they seldom used this latter response, patients told us they appreciated the option. Studying allergy histories of 50 volunteer patients, we found the interview at once well received and effective in eliciting important information, such as a penicillin allergy, not recorded in the hand-written records. Our article describing the study was accepted by the New England Journal of Medicine, and some years later, a past editor Franz Ingelfinger told me this was the first clinical computing article to appear in his journal. I was gratified by the number of supportive messages we received in response to our article, and particularly by extremely reinforcing visits from four eminent physician scientists: Morris Collen and Sidney Garfield from Kaiser Permanente, Raymond Keating from Mayo Clinic, and Alvin Feinstein from Yale. In additional studies involving a general medical history as well as histories for a variety of clinical and psychological problems, patients continued to react favorably to their experience with the computer. Some even said they were more comfortable communicating personal, sensitive information with the computer than with their doctors\u2014a finding that has been repeatedly corroborated by other investigators. Then expanding the approach to the physical examination, I wrote a separate program to interview doctors about their physical exam findings, and this was also well received during a clinical trial. In 1965, Dr. Schilling invited me to join his faculty in the Department of Medicine, and shortly thereafter, Dr. Ben Rosen, Chairman of the newly formed Computer Science Department\u2014one of the first in the country\u2014honored me with a joint faculty appointment, where I greatly enjoyed and benefited from comradeship with colleagues from a variety of disciplines, such as mathematics, linguistics, philosophy and psychology--no \u201ccomputer scientists\u201d as yet, because such degrees had yet to be awarded in this new field. It was in Dr. Rosen\u2019s department I taught \u201cIntroduction to Computers in Medicine,\u201d perhaps one of the first courses of its kind. And in 1967, LINC With  Tomorrow. a 30-minute documentary about our research with computers was produced and distributed, worldwide, by National Public Television for their Spectrum series, a forerunner of Nova. In 1969, Dr. Schilling and I invited Howard Bleich, from Boston\u2019s Harvard Medical School affiliated Beth Israel Hospital, to give grand rounds to our department of medicine about his pioneering work with the computer as a consultant to the doctor. It was clear to Howard Bleich and me on our first meeting that we shared common interests, and in 1970, Howard, with the support of Howard Hiatt, professor of medicine at Harvard and chairman of the hospital\u2019s department of medicine, invited me to join their department. I remained close to Dr. Schilling and my many friends and colleagues at the University of Wisconsin\u2014Ray Chun, Judy Faulkner, John Greist, Sol Kuperman, Maxie Maultsby, and Dick Pope, among many others. In the early 1970s, with the support of Howard Hiatt, Howard Bleich and I formed the Division of Clinical Computing at Beth Israel Hospital, one of the first academic divisions to concentrate on the use of computers for patient care, teaching, and medical research. Our goals over the years\u2014often realized but sometimes not\u2014were to improve the quality and reduce the cost of medical care, enhance the quality of medical education, improve the relationship between doctor and patient, and explore innovative approaches to research through computing. We were fortunate indeed to have outstanding colleagues, such as Bob Beckley, Daniel Geer, Gary Horowitz and Charlie Safran join us with our projects over the years, and to have access to MUMPS, Neil Pappalardo\u2019s pioneering programming language. Howard\u2019s research included groundbreaking projects such as PaperChase, years before the Internet, and the first program to enable online searches of the biomedical literature. And with Bob Beckley, Hollis Kowaloff, Alan Leviton, Bob White, and Jelia Witschi among others, I continued my research with patient-computer dialogue for patients with a variety of medical and psychological (with my brother Charlie) problems as well as a program to help patients manage themselves their urinary tract infections. In the late 1970s, with the support of David Dolins, CFO and Mitchel Rabkin, CEO of Beth Israel hospital, Howard Bleich, Bob Beckley, our colleagues and I were given the mandate to extend our research to the day-to-day operations of the hospital, and a few years later, at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital (where we would do the financial as well as clinical computing). These hospitals became our laboratories in which to develop, implement and study computing designed primarily for use by the clinician and other hospital workers in the care of the patient. We were gratified that our systems were extremely well received by our users in each of these Harvard teaching hospitals. Although supervision of the systems was to be transferred to administrators and the technology updated with Web-based inter-faces, the original database, platform, and server technology would remain in place; and programs derived from our work with patient\u2013 computer dialogue would give patients access to their electronic records from their homes, by a portal over the Internet. I continue with research with patient-computer dialogue, now studying interviews with patients in their homes over the Internet, with highly talented colleagues\u2014Brad Crotty, Adarsha Bajracharya, Henry Feldman, Eli Kaldany, and Hollis Kowaloff among others. Our division, now the Division of Clinical Informatics, is directed and guided admirably by Charlie Safran, a pioneer with numerous creative and fundamental contributions to our field as well as to our programs and my friend and colleague of many years. In short, I have been blessed over the years with wonderful teachers, mentors, colleagues, students and friends and with a wonderful career as a student, doctor, teacher, and scientist. ", "Jack W. Smith": "Professor & Director of Center for BMI at Texas A&M University, formerly Dean of School of BMI, University of Texas Health Science Center & Deputy Director of Medical Informatics at NASA JSC A Personal BMHI Journey My initial forays into biomedical and health informatics (BMHI) and my subsequent career have been guided by interdisciplinary exploration. I find nothing more satisfying and challenging than to scout areas outside biomedicine previously unknown to me and discover what might be relevant to BMHI. Insights from such J.W. Smith, MD, PhD, explorations can be a major joy leading to better ACMI interdisciplinary understanding of biomedicine and BMHI. What motivated me to get started on this path were largely chance opportunities combined with my interests at the time. I had no masterplan to end up where I am today. As a physics undergraduate at Virginia Polytechnic University my intent was to become a physics professor. I was a co-op student majoring in Physics which required working every other quarter away from the Virginia campus in Ohio to pay the bills at school. I worked at the uranium enrichment plant in Piketon, Ohio\u2014which is still there. My work included mathematical models of uranium compound gaseous diffusion across semipermeable membranes, a uranium products inventory system in IBM 1401 assembler, and simulations of exposure risk to radioactive gas release or the radiation flux from a critical mass accident. My first exposure to anything close to BMHI was through biophysics. But that exposure changed all my plans. As a lark, to fill some credit requirements, in my last semester of junior year I took an elective biophysics course being taught for the first time, where we studied fragments of biological systems and their behaviors using physics models and computer simulations. This was in the early 1970s, so our simulations were programmed in FORTRAN, typed on punch cards, and batch processed on an IBM mainframe. Examples I remember well involved the Hodgkin-Huxley equations for simulating the propagation of action potentials in large squid axons and using potential/kinetic energy equations for the rear legs of fleas to model the dynamics of the flea hop. The demonstration that at least fragments of biological system behavior could be mathematically modeled impressed me deeply. This was reinforced by some psychology courses that I was simultaneously taking to fill up elective course requirements. They used mathematics to describe and predict animal behavior in controlled Skinnerian behavioral conditioning experiments. From these beginnings I ended up hooked on combining physics, mathematical models, psychology, neuroscience and computer simulation to help me understand the workings of the mind. These experiences led me to next pursue a multidisciplinary graduate education in medicine and computer science. Such highly interdisciplinary graduate study was not at all standard at the time. I was going to have to make up my own program. My undergraduate psychology mentors encouraged me to go into medicine first (psychiatry\u2014not clinical psychology) because, as they said, \u201cthat\u2019s where the money and  prestige are.\u201d So I crammed into my senior year all the additional courses required for medical school admission, like biochemistry and basic biology. West Virginia University Medical School accepted me. They had a state quota of students to fill and they were experimenting with admitting a few non-traditionally trained students like me. The formal first two years of medical school proved mind- numbing. Full days of lecture materials had to be committed to memory nightly and regurgitated on tests. Fortunately, I quickly found a workaround through an excellent student organized note-taking service and a well-maintained test bank. Then with free time, I fell in with the neuroscience faculty in the Department of Physiology. They were studying the nervous systems of a variety of model organisms and creating anatomic and physiological simulations of those systems. My entry ticket to the group was my skill with FORTRAN, since they needed a programmer for the new FORTRAN compiler on the LINC and PDP-8 lab computers. It was a new multi-pass compiler that output intermediate stages of compilation on punched paper tape. Dr. Millecchia took me on as an undergraduate assistant and I participated in the anatomic and physiological research that worked on understanding the complete nervous system of the barnacle. But, my imagined academic trajectory was about to be again interrupted. This came from two calls\u2014one from the Dean of the Medical School, and the other from the Director of the Medical School Library. The Dean was concerned at my apparent absence from classes and said \u201cJack, you are not attending classes and you are reported to be spending a lot of time with the physiology faculty. You are programming computers. We are worried about you. You know computers will amount to nothing in medicine.\u201d I left hastily with as much grace as I could muster without contradicting him. Confused as to what to do next, I then followed up with the library director. Fortunately, this provided the opening to my future. The director had received a Texas Instrument Teletype from the National Library of Medicine (NLM). This was part of a program to update medical libraries with digital technology. Would I help them set it up and show them how to use this new service from NLM \u2013 MEDLARS? My first search was \u201cDigital AND Computers AND Medicine\u201d. The top citation printed out was on the expert system MYCIN by Ted Shortliffe. It was 1978. I read it. I knew what I was going to do next in my career. I contacted Ted. Through the SUMEX-AIM facility Ted gave me restricted access to run MYCIN. Others in this volume have mentioned how central SUMEX-AIM was to early AI and AI in medicine. Incredible! The behavior of a thoughtful physician considering the choice of antibiotics filled the page for any particular case input. However, I soon learned a certain set of patient features would cause the LISP code to bomb into the operating system with no constraints on use! Now I could run any program such as Greenblatt\u2019s chess program, DENDRAL, and others on SUMEX-AIM. I was hooked on the computational metaphor for the mind, which posits that the mind is something like software running on a digital computer. Of course, we now know this to be an utterly misleading metaphor for scientifically understanding the mind and brain. Cognition we now know, is embodied. Mind cannot be separated from the hardware, as its basic properties and both concrete and abstract concepts are dependent on the specifics of the body and how it interacts with the environment. Once again using MEDLARS, I found a write up of the NLM training programs offered in Biomedical Computing. I researched the programs for my elective last year and inquired at the University of Alabama where the department of Biomedical  Computing had a NLM training grant under Dr. Josiah Macy. They accepted me for a year. My wife and I packed for Birmingham. This was the start of a fascinating year and the real start of my BMHI career. The Department was a cauldron of innovation in informatics and medicine and I also had access to a variety of time-shared mini-computers. I took courses as varied as mathematical modeling of cell metabolism and growth along with the theory of numerical analysis. I worked on computer code for ECG analysis and a module for an ICU subsystem that algorithmically and automatically gave fluids and medications post heart revascularization. My ongoing contacts with Shortliffe and others in the emerging field were convincing me of what I needed to do next: pursing both a residency and PhD in computer science, or getting both tickets punched, as we then said. Where could I do that? Once again, the NLM training programs supplied my list of most likely Universities. An additional consideration was what medical specialty to pursue to complement the PhD in computer science. This was rather easy to decide. I had found that the second thing I liked the least about medicine beyond medical school lectures was taking care of patients. Radiology and Pathology were the two specialties minimally involved with patients, and the one with the least patient care responsibility was the latter. So where could I do a Pathology residency at an NLM-funded training site together with a PhD in Computer science? There were two such NLM training sites. These were the University of Missouri where Dr. Don Lindberg was NLM Training Director and Ohio State University under Dr. Gregory Trezbiakowski. Ohio State became a strong option due once again to serendipity. The Chair of Pathology at the time was Dr. Donald Senhauser, who had worked with Dr. Lindberg at Missouri before moving to Ohio. He was very familiar with the Laboratory Information System (LIS) work Lindberg had done and had been convinced that there would be a significant future for informatics in Pathology. Serendipity struck again when I walked over from the Ohio State Pathology office to Computer Science. I was directed by the Chair to talk to Dr. Chandrasekaran, a pioneer in statistical pattern recognition. By good fortune he had just weeks before attended a lecture at Ohio State by Dr. Ed Feigenbaum from Stanford on expert systems. Frustrated by the plateau that pattern recognition seemed to be stuck in at the time, Chandrasekaran started contemplating working in the emerging field of AI after the lecture. Ed in conversation with him had said biomedicine was where some of the most interesting funded work in AI was to be found. I received a warm welcome when I appeared at Chandrasekaran\u2019s office looking for a PhD advisor. Subsequently, my academic career continues to span biomedicine, mathematics, cognitive science, philosophy of science and cognitive linguistics. Interdisciplinary scholarship remains a major theme in my academic pursuits. A nomadic academic lifestyle has been a good match for a career in our nascent field. After training, I remained at Ohio State University on the faculty of both Computer Science and Pathology. Many relationships made during my training and early years there have been essential throughout my subsequent work. My dissertation on a methodology for combining separate generic tasks in problem-solving methods as working expert systems was the basis for a Research Career Development Award from the NLM. Working with colleagues, the funding from this award resulted in numerous approaches to specialized types of reasoning modules and working medical systems. For example, a knowledge-based tutoring system for complex blood typing based on these ideas was funded by NIHLB. Some SOAR versions of the systems also emerged from  the SOAR collaborative under Dr. Allen Newell at CMU. A highlight of my early career was the collaboration with Allen and the people that surrounded him. During these years my passion for models of both human cognition and artificial intelligence kept growing. I had the privilege of directing the NLM Training Program at Ohio State University for many years and acting as Assistant Director for the Cognitive Science Center. It was a joy to pay forward for all the support that I had received from the people and programs at the NLM, which has been so critical to my work as it has been to that of so many others contributing to this volume. Indeed, it is hard to imagine that BMHI in the USA would have flourished without it. For me, a big change came in 1998 with an opportunity to participate in a somewhat crazy idea at the University of Texas Health Science Center (UTHSC) in Houston, Texas. The President at UTHSC (a neuroscientist) was shutting down the School of Allied Health, since such training programs in Texas were gradually migrating to community colleges. UTHSC decided to create a School of Health Informatics with some of its freed budget. This became the first and is still the only School of Biomedical Informatics in the US. The School was started comprised of the soon-to-be-former Dean Allied Health Dr. Doris Ross, myself, a local professor Dr Jim Turley and some former Ohio State faculty that I recruited. Our School became a training partner of the longstanding NLM training program under Dr. Tony Gorry at Rice University. By chance NASA Johnson Space Center at this same time became interested in implementing an EMR for tracking the health of astronauts and their families. I got involved through an introduction by an early pioneer in Pathology Informatics, Dr. Bob Beck in Houston. I was invited to an early meeting considering the issues involved. The Pathologist in charge of Space Medicine at Johnson Space Center (JSC), Dr. Craig Fischer, and his associate Dr. Jim Logan attended that meeting. We hit it off. For six years I split my time in Houston between the University and JSC. At JSC I held a civil service position with the new title Deputy Director of Medical Informatics and Healthcare Systems. This new office grew from Dr. Jim Logan as Director and myself to have broad responsibility for all bioengineering and health support systems in the US human space flight program. A former student, Dr. Kathy Johnson, now leads this large and highly successful enterprise. Subsequently, our HTHSC School, renamed the School of Biomedical Informatics under my tenure as Dean, has became a major force in the field. I have realized for some time that I am at heart more of a serial academic entrepreneur, rather than a manager of a large organization. I have moved universities recently to start a new Center for Biomedical Informatics at Texas A&M where I have the opportunity to fully focus on new theoretical and application interests. My colleagues and I have successfully implemented tele-health, distributed EMR and mobile-health systems in Colombia in cooperation with both the national and state governments. I have also had the opportunity to start a new research focus on the relevance of the emerging new sciences of cognitive linguistics as related to embodied cognition in biomedicine. This collaborative work now includes Dr. George Lakoff and Dr. Eve Sweetser with their cognitive linguistic group at Berkeley. Kaz Kulikowski at Rutgers has also joined these new investigations. Developing routers while making these new mappings and exploring their implications for BMHI is proving to be a fascinating navigational adventure. ", "William Stead": "Chief Strategy Officer, Vanderbilt University Medical Center McKesson Foundation Professor, Department of Biomedical Informatics Professor, Department of Medicine I was first drawn to computing in 1968 during an introductory Fortan programming course I took at Duke during the summer between my sophomore and junior year as an undergraduate. We were instructed to use the punch card machines in the computer center and to submit our programs for batch processing. I found a card reader and printer in the Engineering School with a remote connection to the computer center. This access point was unattended W. Stead, MD, FACMI overnight. I used it to test as many algorithms as I could think for each assignment. I inserted print statements with the time to see which ran fastest. I learned I did not need to know the best approach; I could simulate the alternatives and find out. I was hooked! Fall of my junior year, I joined C. Frank Starmer as a work study student in Duke Hospital\u2019s Myocardial Infarction Research Unit. Frank is an electrical engineer with a doctoral degree in biomathematics and bioengineering. He and his research team were using a minicomputer (SDS Sigma V) located next to the cardiac care unit to see if a digital computer could support care in ways that analog computers could not. Frank developed real time data acquisition interfaces and he taught me how to write interactive graphic programs using a television and keyboard that he interfaced to the computer. I learned I could adapt the user interface to meet my needs! My connection to medical informatics became tighter. As I watched work in the intensive care unit, I realized the physicians had the most freedom to use the computer to change how they worked. I decided to go to medical school and was accepted at Duke. The Duke curriculum compressed requirements into 2 years, freeing a full year for basic research. Medical computing was not an established research track at the time, so E. Harvey Estes, Chairman of the Department of Community Health Sciences, agreed that I could work with W. Edward Hammond in his computer lab and receive credit for independent study. My father suggested I start this rd \u201c3 year research\u201d during the summer between college and medical school. Ed is an electrical and biomedical engineer. l joined Ed as one of a team of five medical and undergraduate students. Ed gave us general guidance, answered our questions, and gave us freedom to try and fail. Together we developed assembly language programs for the PDP-12 and merged them into GEMISCH \u2013 an application development and database management environment. I worked with Dr. Al Heyman in Neurology and used this environment to develop an interactive video questionnaire to capture a self- report of their present illness from patients presenting with headache. We published an evaluation showing the program\u2019s differential diagnosis was comparable to that of attending neurologists in Archives of Internal Medicine, now JAMA Internal Medicine. I learned that I could adapt the user interface for understanding by patients. My connection to medical informatics was complete.  From these origins, my career in biomedical informatics spans forty-eight years. Throughout this time, I have focused on three biomedical informatics challenges. The first is system innovation through development of methods to find the right fit among people, process and technology. These methods involve envisioning a new way of working that is impossible without new technology and figuring out how to test the change before the technology is mature. In the 1970s and 1980s I did this by programming small workable systems such as the interactive video headache history taker and user interfaces to present views of data adapted to role or task of the user. In the 1990s I explored whole system change through short video segments to bring visions of possible ways of working to life without waiting to develop the technology. In the 2000s, I implemented the DesignShop process for rapid cycle group creative work and developed innovation life-cycle management methods at Vanderbilt to support the shift to system-based care, learning and research needed to personalize medicine. The second is specification and implementation of informatics architectures to separate data management, data interpretation and knowledge management from the transaction processing and electronic medical record systems used in health care. In the 1970s and 1980s, this separation took the form of metadata dictionaries to manage terminology, display and process flow separate from application code. In the 1990s they took the form of enterprise architectures to separate management of a healthcare entity\u2019s information content from commercial applications or locally developed informatics tools. In the 2000\u2019s we worked out methods to extend these architectures across enterprise boundaries. The resulting data liquidity let researchers measure at multiple biologic, time and geographic scales and triangulate signals for robust interpretation matching the computation method to the scale of the problem. The third is organization development to incorporate biomedical informatics as an organic part of academic medicine, industry and the US national agenda. Within Vanderbilt, I tested methods to align organizational structure, informatics architecture and change management to bring cutting-edge research in decision support, visualization, natural language processing, data mining, and data privacy into clinical practice as a standard of care. I developed diverse approaches to moving the capabilities developed at Vanderbilt to society through licensing, open source and consortia. I worked within AMIA and ACMI, the US Department of Health and Human Services and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine to develop informatics as a profession and as a national resource. Over the course of my career, technology has become much more powerful and ubiquitous. These advances have allowed the informatics team to move up the value chain, devoting more of their effort to new ways to working and less to cobbling the technology together. At the same time, the three challenge areas have remained central to progress in the field. Over the next decade, the frontier of system innovation will include contextual awareness, cognitive support and predictive decision support. The frontier of informatics architectures will include ways to \u201cdesign in\u201d cyber-security, plug-and-play interoperability, and segmentation. The frontier of organization development will include ways to connect \u201cbig data science\u201d hypothesis generation with \u201csmall science\u201d hypothesis testing and pragmatic effectiveness studies to accelerate discovery and learning. ", "Peter Szolovits": "Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, MIT Professor of Health Sciences and Technology, MIT Head of Clinical Decision Making Group at MIT CS&AI Lab 2013 Recipient of Morris F. Collen Award of Excellence I completed my PhD in 1974 at Caltech under the supervision of Prof. Frederick B. Thompson and was fortunate enough to be appointed an Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering (our department only added \u201cand Computer Science\u201d to its title a couple of years later). Fred was trained as a logician, under Alfred Tarski at Berkeley, and had moved through his career to applications. His 1966 paper, \u201cEnglish for the Computer,\u201d outlined an influential approach to using natural language as the interface between human and computer, centered on the idea of a homomorphism between syntactic and semantic structure. His research group at Caltech worked on realizing this vision, and around 1970 built a complete operating and application system\u2014called the Rapidly Extensible Language (REL) system\u2014that used a triple-store instead of a file system as its base and a context-sensitive parser to drive its very flexible interface. We experimented with (on?) users ranging from artists to anthropologists. My thesis work was on easily building specialized application languages for users with idiosyncratic data and analytic needs. The critical problem I wanted to focus on as a faculty member was how to represent information about the real world in a computer, to allow it to reason as well as to store data. In addition to working with Bill Martin on natural language problems and re- implementing my thesis project in Lisp (to learn the language well), I spent a few months discussing with colleagues in various disciplines how this interest in representation mapped to the kinds of problems they worked on. I was introduced to Steve Pauker, then a young cardiologist at Tufts/New England Medical Center, and Bill Schwartz, then chief of Medicine at Tufts. They were collaborating with Tony Gorry at MIT and Jerry Kassirer and other colleagues at Tufts, first on applying decision analytic methods to individual patient decisions and then on developing \u201cmental models\u201d inspired by Newell and Simon\u2019s \u201cHuman Problem Solving\u201d to capture clinical reasoning. Tony was in the process of de-camping to join Michael DeBakey\u2019s empire in Houston, I was intrigued by these problems, and I expressed an interest in working with the group. Bill and Steve arrived at my office just before Christmas 1974 and dumped a copy of Harrison\u2019s medical text on my desk and said \u201cHere, kid. Read this and then let\u2019s talk!\u201d MIT has an independent activities period during all of January and I used it to read Harrison\u2019s (with much help from Steadman\u2019s medical dictionary), and showed up at Steve\u2019s office saying \u201cOK, I\u2019ve read it.\u201d He laughed, informed me that nobody read all of Harrison\u2019s, but we immediately liked each other and started to work together. I quickly realized that to do good work in this domain, we would need access to electronic data, which in 1974-5 was very rare. Therefore, I did a back-of-the-envelope calculation of when such data were likely to become available. I calculated that the cost of electronic storage of data would cross the cost of paper storage around 1981-3 and  anticipated that by the time we had worked out useful method of decision support, bulk data would be available to test them. I was only off by about three decades! It turned out that the cost of storage was a much smaller factor than the enormous institutional investments needed to transform the way a health care system works, to make it electronic. Partners Healthcare in Boston is said to have spent nearly $2B in the late 2010\u2019s to install the Epic system throughout. Another daunting obstacle to my choice of this field occurred soon after I started to work with Steve. Marvin Minsky, the Godfather of Artificial Intelligence, took me out to lunch one day to persuade me that choosing to work on medical decision making was to \u201cwaste my career!\u201d Marvin believed, for most of his career, that the root problem of AI was to understand common-sense reasoning, and he felt that expert reasoning such as that in medicine would teach us little about common sense. I recall going home to worry through this with my partner Dianne, and was really conflicted about whether to take the Great Man\u2019s advice seriously. However, the next day, a stubby lady walked into my office, introduced herself as Gloria, Marvin\u2019s wife and a pediatrician, and told me to \u201cJust ignore Marvin!\u201d Steve had implemented a version of the Present Illness Program in Conniver, a Prolog-like programming language that used dependency-directed backtracking rather than chronological, developed by Gerry Sussman. It was very expressive and elegant, but very slow on the PDP-10 time sharing system (supporting dozens of users) that we then used. My first effort, therefore, was to re-implement that program in straight Lisp, with a lot of optimizations and a new capability of reasoning about a coarse model of the progression of time (past, recent-past, present, near-future, future). I was pleasantly surprised when our program, being told of a current streptococcal infection, hypothesized a near-future acute glomerulonephritis (AGN)\u2014a capability I had not anticipated, but which was a logical consequence of the model, which included that a current AGN could have been caused by a recent strep infection. The program\u2019s responsiveness also improved some; during the busy afternoon, one could still grab a cup of coffee between entering a fact and seeing a revised hypothesis, but there was no longer time for a whole meal. I was very fortunate to recruit my first three of a long succession of superb graduate students, Bill Swartout, Ramesh Patil, and Brian Cantwell Smith. They were all about my age, and I remember our sense that none of us really understood how to \u201csolve\u201d the medical representation problem, but we were excited to work on it. They all went on to great careers in computer science and related fields, and their success undoubtedly helped me to survive the winnowing tenure process for young professors. Bill focused on how to use explicit representations of routines to explain the conclusions of a program, Ramesh on how to combine pathophysiological (causal) and associational knowledge, and Brian on the core problem of representation and computation. I had become convinced that diagnosis, despite the large role it played in the popular imagination, was less important as a focus in decision support research than intervention selection. After all, few doctors have a one-shot interaction with a patient; instead, they form tentative diagnostic hypotheses, decide on and carry out some intervention, see its results, and repeatedly revise their understanding of the case. Intervention includes either further testing, actual treatment, or just watching and waiting to see how the patient\u2019s condition evolves. This focus on the diagnosis/therapy cycle has informed my work ever since. As the \u201cexpert system\u201d era came into full force in the late 1970\u2019s and early to mid- 1980\u2019s, I found myself embroiled in the West-coast/East-coast argument about rules vs. frames as the natural representation of expertise. The rule-based systems popularized by ", "Ted Shortliffe\u2019s Mycin and advocated by Ed Feigenbaum had the appeal of simplicity": "and wound up launching a thousand applications in the 1980\u2019s. The early Innovative Applications of AI (IAAI) meetings were full of Mycin-inspired systems for every task from how to clean industrial scale soup vats to how to schedule aircraft maintenance. Nevertheless, my experience with such systems made me doubt the claim that rules were essentially independent and thus easily explainable. As the set of rules expanded when a system became broader and more sophisticated, interactions between rules became much more difficult to understand, and rules didn\u2019t seem to provide appropriate mechanisms to allow for the creation of higher-level abstractions in the representation and reasoning process. Frames and, more generally, computer programs, did provide such abstractions and therefore appealed to me more. Swartout\u2019s work showed that one could also tailor explanation capabilities into systems based on programs, by using automatic programming methods to create the programs from underlying principles about their domains. The medical domain is also rife with uncertainty, which required improved computational methods. Early work in the field on Bayesian models tended to make vast independence assumptions that are sometimes a poor fit to reality. Various approaches to this included certainty factors in rule-based systems and various probability calculi, including one Steve and I tried to add to the Present Illness Program. It was not until the work of Judea Pearl and of Greg Cooper in the early 1980\u2019s that we came to understand Bayesian networks as a much better representation of probabilistic dependency. They also taught us that purely local computational methods such as we had pursued cannot be correct when variables are connected via multiple paths, and that the correct exact computations are non-polynomially complex, requiring the use of approximation methods. From a review of many extant AI systems in medicine that Steve and I published in 1978, I became convinced that the enormous variability of complex medical cases, which often involved multiple simultaneous diseases, needed representations that could, to some extent, model the causal interactions among different disease processes. Ideally, of course, one could write down the differential equations that describe all of physiology and pathophysiology, but this was clearly not feasible. However, qualitative or semi- quantitative versions of such models might help. A motivating example for some of our work was a patient experiencing both vomiting and diarrhea. Either of those conditions can be expected to alter the patient\u2019s serum pH because one leads to loss of acid, the other to loss of alkali. However, if they are balanced, it\u2019s possible to have a normal pH in the face of both conditions. It does not make sense, however, to list \u201cnormal pH\u201d as a symptom of that combination of diseases in a typical disease/symptom representation. Patil\u2019s work built multi-level associational models, where the deepest ones included quantitative accounts of measured abnormalities and the shallowest used only surface associations. Later, Bill Long in my group developed sophisticated qualitative representations to help interpret complex cases of congestive heart disease. I think the early work mentioned above motivated my election to ACMI. I continue to work after 44 years in the field, having addressed many additional technical topics since 1984, and having supervised over 35 doctoral theses, over 70 master\u2019s theses, served on an additional 55 doctoral committees, and supervised over 50 undergraduate projects. My current work focuses on developing machine learning based predictive models to serve as the basis for decision support in clinical medicine, integrating multi- modal data, and interpreting clinical narratives, but my research interests are broad and thus I engage in many other related projects. ", "Paul Tang": "Vice President, IBM Watson Health Former Chief Medical Information Officer and Chief Innovation and Technology Officer, Palo Alto Medical Co-chair, US Health Information Technology Policy committee Past Board Chairs, AMIA, CPRI, JHITA Having trained as an electrical engineer, my propensity for taking a systematic approach to solving problems addressable by technology influenced me from my earliest days in the practice of medicine. During my internal medicine residency at Stanford in the 1980s, I had a continuity clinic at the Palo Alto Veterans Administration (VA) Hospital. It was not uncommon for the paper medical record to be several inches thick, requiring a considerable amount of foraging in order to find the information relevant to making clinical decisions. Yet, 30% percent of the time, the chart was missing. So began my journey to tackle the information-management problem in healthcare. Bothered by the information-access problem, I created a \"mini medical record\" in the VA computer system for use in my clinic. Having read the luminary work of Dr. Clement MacDonald at Regenstrief Institute, I patterned the format of the record summary after his Medical Gopher encounter summary. I manually entered the problem list, medication list, and allergy list, of all my patients into DHCP, the VA\u2019s electronic health record (EHR) system. Every week I would print out the summaries for the patients scheduled for my clinic and wrote my progress notes on that summary form. After each visit, I would update the summary lists in DHCP. I performed the same service for a few other clinicians, so while some of us always had access to our patients\u2019 summary information, this labor-intensive process was not scalable. Before starting a cardiology fellowship, I placed a random call to the technology company most associated with electronic health data at the time, Hewlett-Packard (HP)\u2014the predominant manufacturer of ICU monitors. Although ICU monitors generated significant amounts of data, there were no data management tools to find longitudinal trends or to combine them with any other data. I learned that the medical department at HP Labs was beginning to look at the problem of data management in healthcare, while other researchers at the Labs were studying artificial intelligence. My hope was to combine the two. I continued teaching at Stanford and working at my clinic at the VA, naively expecting to return once I helped HP develop a computerized medical record. Although I never stopped practicing medicine, I also never returned to full-time practice. At the time, in the early 1980s, AI was rapidly being catapulted into the Gartner \"hype phase.\" While some computer-science researchers thought AI might replace physician decision-making, I felt it would be more productive to support physicians by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of the computer to visualize underlying data in ways that map to the human's medicine-trained mental model. Thinking about how human physicians organize data in their minds, it seemed to me that understanding human physiology and the disease process was the way physicians approached problem-solving and data analysis, as illustrated by Kulikowski and Weiss\u2019s work on CASNET.  To create a knowledge-based clinical decision support system for physicians, I started a project in which we programmed a basic physiology model into our system as a way of determining what data were relevant to visualize for physicians that is pertinent to a particular disease and its treatment. We developed a service-based architecture that communicated the patient's context amongst the services. The underlying physiology model was the engine that reasoned about associations between diseases and medications and lab tests. Although this knowledge-based view of patient data from an EHR was received favorably by physicians in an evaluation, the blocking impediment was that EHR systems existed in only a handful of institutions at the time. The challenge was to increase the adoption of EHR systems. Coincidentally the Institute of Medicine (IOM) expressed an interest in conducting a study. I helped the IOM write up the project plan to secure funding and served as co-chair of the strategy and implementation subcommittee. In its 1991 report, the IOM committee concluded that the computer-based patient record was an \"essential technology for healthcare.\" However, the committee identified critical issues impeding the development and adoption of computerized patient records, including the lack of: well-defined use cases, data standards, vocabulary, unique health identifiers, and comprehensive privacy regulation. A unifying public-private entity, the Computer-based Patient Record Institute (CPRI) was proposed, and the report received widespread attention and was oversubscribed, requiring a third printing \u2013 the first time in IOM history. Soon after the report was published, a number of professional societies and trade associations collaborated to establish the CPRI. I chaired the CPRI board, and we conducted a Summit in 1996 to focus on three of the leading barriers to the development and adoption of computer-based patient record systems \u2013 unique health identifiers, privacy considerations, and standards. Later that year, HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, was passed, addressing all three of the summit topics. To inspire and recognize organizations that achieved demonstrable impact from their computer-based patient records (CPRs), I led a CPRI work group establishing the Nicholas E. Davies Award for Excellence in CPR Implementation, modeled after the Malcolm Baldrige award. HIMMS later acquired the program, which continues today. Despite an emerging commercial effort to promote the adoption of EHRs, uptake was very slow. However, individual health systems began looking at EHRs as the modern way of storing and managing health information. I personally answered one of those calls when Northwestern Memorial Hospital decided it wanted to implement an EHR in its new medical center being built in downtown Chicago. In 1996, with funding from the NLM, I implemented an ambulatory EHR from a startup EHR company, Epic, in five diverse ambulatory care settings\u2014primary care, specialty care, academic practice, community practice, and safety-net clinic. As part of the implementation process, I created an EHR team composed of clinicians to work directly with physicians during implementation and later during optimization. One of the aims of the NLM-funded study was to assess whether using EHRs improved care. At the time, only home-grown academic systems had been evaluated. I worked with Epic to develop a rules-based decision-support system (known as Best Practice Advisories) into their EHR. As part of the evaluation study, we implemented the EHR in half of a large internal medicine faculty practice at Northwestern while the other half continued to use paper medical records. In subsequent evaluation studies comparing the two practices, the physicians who used the EHR achieved twice the immunization rate for influenza vaccination, produced more complete notes, and in a summative evaluation made significantly more appropriate  clinical decisions than those physicians using the paper record, as judged by a blinded panel of senior physicians. I employed a similar approach when I implemented an EHR at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation (PAMF), a large medical group practice in California, which was building a new building and wanted to implement an EHR as part of their vision for a new health system. Despite being in the heart of Silicon Valley, when I joined in 1998, there were no computers, no email, and no networking at PAMF. My job was to implement an EHR there. In addition to implementing the EHR, we had to respond to another emerging force in 2000 \u2013 the Internet\u2019s role in everyday life. Consumers, particularly in Silicon Valley, began to demand access to the clinic and its physicians in the same way they accessed other services. In a board-approved initiative, we decided to work with our vendor, Epic, \u2122 to develop a patient portal (MyChart ) so that consumers could access data from their medical record, make appointments, and communicate with their physicians online. PAMF was the first to implement MyChart in 2001, and currently over 88% of PAMF\u2019s patients are online. By 2008, only 4% of US physician offices had a fully functional EHR system. In order to accelerate adoption of EHRs, members of the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) community sought to take a more proactive role in public policy. As chair of AMIA, I met with congressional staff to encourage the development of legislation that would provide incentives to adopt EHRs. In 2007 I met with David Bowen, the lead health legislative assistant, to the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, and the Administrator of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Dr. Mark McClellan. I had developed a proposal that included incentives for adopting health information technology in three phases with increasing system requirements in each phase, covering the dimensions of electronic health record, decision-support, and patient support. In the plan, I had proposed an incentive program with decreasing incentive payment over time in order to speed adoption. Although Sen. Kennedy introduced legislation a few weeks later, it was never voted upon because the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) did not accept the argument that the estimates of cost savings cited in academic papers would pay for the cost of the incentives proposed. Fast forward to 2009. In the midst of an economic crisis caused by a banking scandal, Congress was forced to pass an economic stimulus bill, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. That bill was drafted hurriedly in a matter of six weeks. Key to this story of serendipity was the fact that David Bowen was present and acted to insert the HITECH (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health) provision into a bill that had to be passed. The framework was very similar to what I had discussed with David in 2007. The critical difference this time around was that because of the nature of ARRA\u2014it was specifically designed to stimulate the economy\u2014it did not have to pay for the HITECH incentives from other sources! A key provision of HITECH was the requirement that organizations who want to receive the EHR incentive payment must demonstrate that they use the technology meaningfully\u2014the Meaningful Use requirement. Furthermore, the earlier the healthcare organization adopted and demonstrated meaningful use of EHRs, the more incentive money the organization earned, and it avoided later penalties. The law took a carrot-and- stick approach. The law authorized and appropriated money, estimated to be $30 billion, for the EHR incentive program, but setting the criteria for what constitutes \u201cmeaningful use\u201d was left to the Department of Health and Human Services. The HITECH provision also authorized the formation of two federal advisory committees, the HIT Policy Committee (HITPC) and the HIT Standards Committee  (HITSC). The policy committee was established to provide advice on policies related to health information technology and the standards committee was to provide advice on health information technology standards. One of the main responsibilities of the HITPC was to make recommendations about the criteria for the Meaningful Use program. I co- chaired the HITPC and chaired the Meaningful Use workgroup that developed the recommendations. One of the original considerations that guided the Meaningful Use workgroup was the notion of phasing in requirements over time. The workgroup identified three initial phases of work that had to be done on a countrywide level. In stage 1, the focus was on capturing information in the electronic record system and starting the path towards computer-based physician order entry. An interesting but significant criterion we added during the definition of the Meaningful Use criteria was the addition of a requirement that EHRs provide patients with access to their health data. That was a pivotal recommendation to facilitate the democratization of health and healthcare. The goal of stage 2 was to create an environment for effective health information exchange. The goal of stage 3, which was envisioned to begin six years later, was to measure and improve outcomes using the EHRs. By that time, it was felt that payment reform would \"pull\" demand for EHRs, given the necessity of having computerized tools to measure and improve healthcare organizational performance. The vast majority of the recommendations of the HITPC for stages 1 and 2 were accepted by CMS. Five years after the MU program was implemented, over 80% of physician practices and 98% of hospitals had adopted EHR systems. \u201cOvernight\u201d the US went from last place in the developed world for adoption of EHRs to first place. Without the policy intervention of HITECH, there would not be any \u2018big data\u2019 to analyze, and the precision medicine initiative would not have rich phenotypic data to study. Now that national adoption of EHRs has been achieved, I decided to return to the underlying problem to solve\u2014supplying physicians, patients, and the other members of the health team with relevant information needed to make informed, evidence-based decisions related to an individual's health. In a recapitulation of how I started in medical informatics, I have resumed my quest to apply artificial intelligence to support physicians making clinical decisions. This time around, not only are most of the clinical data captured in EHRs, but also the world is being instrumented and wired so that clinical decisions can be informed by consideration of the whole person, not limited to data about diseases. I have joined IBM Watson Health to apply a rich set of technologies (such as natural language processing, machine learning, big-data analytics, image analysis, computer-assisted collaboration, etc.), capabilities, and data to improve health and healthcare. Leveraging modern computing capabilities, medical informatics practitioners can provide clinicians with better tools to make more holistic decisions, taking into account not only clinical data, but also data on social determinants of health, genomics, preferences, and behavioral characteristics. Thirty years ago, the field had limited tools to operate on limited data. With the stimulus of HITECH incentives and the emergence of advanced computing technology, the world has changed. But the goal remains the same\u2014systematize making the right thing to do the obvious and easiest thing to do\u2014for the whole health team, including individuals and families. ", "Peter Tarczy-Hornoch": "Chair, Department of Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education Professor of Pediatrics Adj. Professor of Computer Science & Engineering University of Washington My first taste of medical and health informatics was when I was doing software development in a variety of real time instrumentation control applications. My work was broad ranging and included aerospace, industrial, military and biomedical applications. Though not traditional biomedical informatics work it did introduce me to software applications in the biomedical space. I found myself particularly drawn toward biomedical applications due to their potential to improve human health. The projects I worked on early on included embedded software control systems for intravenous fluid pumps and EKG analysis to synchronize a mechanical pump to the R wave. Based on this background when I went to Stanford I was thinking about focusing on computer science or bioengineering. In 1983 I then discovered the Medical Information Sciences (MIS) program at Stanford through taking the decision support course taught by Edward (Ted) Shortliffe and Bruce Buchanan. Thus was my passion born for the then relatively young field that is now known as biomedical informatics. My initial work in the field as an undergraduate was quite varied. I worked on research projects with David Heckerman and Eric Horvitz who were both MD PhD graduate students at the time. My work with them including helping build the knowledge acquisition system for the Pathfinder Bayesian belief system using a proprietary HP system as well as building a PC version of the Pathfinder knowledge acquisition system and decision support system using Turbo Pascal. I worked in LISP with Larry Fagan on his oncology expert system that was derived from eMycin. With him I also developed a prototype probabilistic based system written in LISP to predict white blood cell (WBC) counts following chemotherapy based on a model that included the drugs used, the response in other patients of the WBC to those drugs, as well as the patients own previous history of WBC response to chemotherapy. Through the MIS program I met Gio Wiederhold who also served as an inspiration. During this time, I founded a biomedical software development company and contracted on a range of projects including a) a system to analyze spectrophotometric data from bacterial cultures to identity the species earlier than standard visual color identification, b) more EKG analysis software for cardiac retro-perfusion systems, c) a real time emergency department electronic white board, and d) an adaptive control system for hyperthermia systems for oncology written in LISP. Through my work with and mentorship from Ted, Larry, Bruce, Eric and David I was inspired to pursue medical informatics (as it was then known) as a career that allowed me to make a difference in the lives of doctors and patients while using my love for and skill in software development. The more I studied informatics the more I realized how little medicine I knew yet how critical this knowledge was. Based on the role model and mentorship provided by Ted as an informaticist and a practicing physician and my own grandfather who was a general practitioner in Hungary I went to medical school at Stanford (1985-89). In  medical school I continued to attend informatics seminars and presentations whenever my schedule allowed. My software development focus shifted back to hyperthermia systems for oncology. I developed multiple generations of software control systems written in C for experimental microwave hyperthermia systems that both monitored the temperature and adjusted the microwave beams as well as driving stepper motors to move both microwave antennae and thermocouples. Working with William (Bill) Benitz I wrote a medical scholars dissertation on a mathematical model for the heterogeneous time constant lung undergoing mechanical ventilation to solve a vexing problem of how to optimally ventilate premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. During my pediatric residency at the University of Minnesota (1989-92), I was fortunate to be able to piece together a 3-month elective rotation with Lael Gatewood and a number of students in the informatics program there. In retrospect the project I worked on was effectively the functional requirement for a very early generation clinical research informatics system. Whereas my time at Stanford taught me the critical importance of a strong methodological foundation for biomedical informatics my time at Minnesota taught me the importance and the lessons one could learn by developing, deploying and scaling up to full production informatics systems in real world settings. The next phase of my development as an informaticist was during my neonatology fellowship at the University of Washington (UW) 1992-95. As part of my fellowship my research focused on mathematical modeling along with physiological experiments looking at the term and preterm lung under conditions of total and partial liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbons. During this time, I discovered the UW biomedical and health informatics research group through the informatics research colloquium created by Sherrilynne (Sherri) Fuller as part of the UW IAIMS grant and the introductory medical informatics course taught by Bill Cole. I was thereby introduced to the research being done by Ira Kalet, Brent Stewart, Jim Brinkley and Cornelius Rosse. This was a tremendously exciting time with the faculty at UW working on projects both at the foundational and methodologic area as well as on projects that were being deployed in the real world. The UW IAIMS grant was a seminal event both in the development of the UW program as well as my own career as a young faculty in informatics (1995-2001). The IAIMS grant brought the informatics faculty together into a common forum and venue. When I asked Sherri Fuller for advice and mentorship on developing a career in informatics as a junior faculty at UW, she brought me into her IAIMS grant projects as a physician informaticist. With her support I became the informatics lead for MINDscape, a web based electronic medical record system that integrated information from a clinical data repository, multiple other clinical systems as well as context sensitive information from the nascent UW digital health library (also developed as part of the UW IAIMS project). The paper describing MINDscape was my anchor publication for my election to ACMI (1). This led to work with Sherri Fuller and Brent Stewart on the Bench to Bedside and Beyond Next Generation Internet grant. In parallel Sherri facilitated what became a decade long collaboration with Roberta (Bonnie) Pagon (a pediatric geneticist) on the development of a directory (GeneTests) and knowledge base (GeneClinics) on the application of genetic testing (2). The MINDscape and GeneTests/GeneClinics work formed the foundation for my later work on data integration. The IAIMS grant coalesced the informatics faculty at UW and led to the creation in 1997 of the Division of Biomedical and Health Informatics in the renamed Department of Medical Education and Biomedical Informatics under the leadership of Fred Wolf (Department Chair) and  Sherri Fuller (founding Division Head). This in turn led to getting funding from UW to create an MS and PhD program in biomedical informatics (under the leadership of Ira Kalet and many other faculty) and an NLM training grant (with myself, Sherri Fuller, and Ira Kalet as leads). This program emphasized both the methodologic foundations and the real world applications of informatics and was designed to expose all trainees to bioinformatics, clinical informatics and public health/population informatics (with consumer health informatics added later as well). Establishing the program led to the recruitment of many new informatics faculty to UW including Wanda Pratt, John Gennari, and Bryant Karras. nd In 2001 I became Division Head and in a 2 phase of faculty recruitment the Department brought on more faculty including George Demiris, Neil Abernethy, Anne Turner, Meliha Yetisgen, and Nick Anderson. This phase of the Department continued to unite faculty now in a shared educational mission in addition to a shared research mission. It led to the establishment with the School of Nursing of a jointly run distance learning MS program in applied clinical informatics MS (the Clinical Informatics and Patient Centered Technologies (CIPCT) program) focused on nurses and physicians. In 2012 I became the Chair of the Department (now the Department of Biomedical rd Informatics and Medical Education, bime.uw.edu) and began a 3 phase of faculty recruitment and the formalization of the key operational role that informatics was now playing in both the research and clinical missions of the UW School of Medicine and the UW Health System including the recruitment of Sean Mooney as Chief Research Information Officer, Adam Wilcox as Chief Analytics Officer, and Mike Leu as our founding Clinical Informatics Fellowship program director. Our departmental vision is to realize the potential for electronic biomedical data to improve health through research, teaching and the practice of informatics through operations and service. Since becoming a faculty in 1995 my own research career has evolved in parallel with that of the UW program overall. I have had the privilege of working with over 50 gifted faculty in informatics and personally working with over 40 MS, PhD and post- doctoral students. The trend in biomedicine of the explosion of the quantity of biomedical data, knowledge and information has driven my own research agenda since 2001. Broadly my goal has been to integrate diverse sources of biomedical data for both discovery and to support clinicians and patients. I have focused on a) data integration: creating systems to help make sense of and systematically organize this flood of information in order to generate new knowledge, and b) bringing the knowledge to the point of clinical care. At the foundational level two grants focused on data integration \u201cBioMediator: Biologic Data Integration and Analysis System\u201d (2003-7, NIH, PI) and \u201cInformation Integration in the Presence of Uncertainty (UII)\u201d (2005-10, NSF, co-PI). These data integration approaches in collaboration with many of my PhD students provided insights into new approaches to data integration and the use of data integration for generating new biomedical knowledge (3),(4). I served on the external advisory boards of two National Centers for Biomedical Computing: \u201cInformatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2)\u201d (Harvard), and \u201cIntegrating Data for Analysis, Anonimization and Sharing (iDASH)\u201d (UC San Diego). The BioMediator and UII work formed the basis for my applied data integration research as part of the UW led Institute for Translational Health Sciences (ITHS) Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) grants building on my prior work in applied data integration on the MINDscape web based EHR. In my role as founding Director of the Biomedical Informatics Core of the ITHS my focus was on data integration and the secondary use of electronic medical records to support clinical and translational research building on my GeneTests and  GeneClinics work. This bridging of the biological and clinical divide by myself and many other leaders led to the establishment of the domain of translational bioinformatics (the area for which I now serve as an Associate Editor for JBI). Two key pragmatic outcomes of this applied research were a) the formal adoption and funding of an Enterprise Data Warehouse by UW Medicine, and b) the incorporation of support of research into the UW Medicine Information Technology Services strategic plan. These pragmatic outcomes above enabled multiple additional grants that leverage electronic clinical data and systems in support of research. Each of these grants had or has both foundational and applied informatics research components. Two grants leveraged the enterprise data warehouse to enable automated real time identification of patients meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria for research studies seeking biospecimens \u201cCancer Consortium Biospecimen Program\u201d (Porter, PI) and \u201cWashington Phenotyped Biospecimen Resource\u201d (Slattery, PI). The \u201cSurgical Care and Outcomes Assessment Program Comparative Effectiveness Research Translation Network\u201d grant (Flum PI) has integration of clinical data from electronic medical records across multiple healthcare systems for Comparative Effectiveness research (including text mining) as one of its two aims (also leveraging the enterprise warehouse). The \u201cInstitute for Genetic Medicine\u201d grant (Jarvik PI) informatics core focuses on leveraging the warehouse and text mining to enable phenotyped cohort discovery to enable translational genomic research. The informatics core of the \u201cClinical sequencing in cancer: Clinical, ethical and technological studies\u201d grant (Jarvik PI) focuses on integrating new genomic knowledge and incidental findings from whole exome sequencing into the electronic medical record. In looking back at my own history in biomedical informatics as well as that of the department at the University of Washington I am struck both by how the driving core vision of using biomedical data and software to improve health has remained relatively constant as well as by how much harder it has been to achieve this goal than I or any of my mentors or colleagues would have imagined at all the institutions I\u2019ve had the privilege of training and/or working at. It seems though despite the challenges we are entering a wonderful era for biomedical informatics. People outside the discipline including research funders, healthcare system funders, businesses and patients are seeing the potential for data and modern computing approaches to transform healthcare, biomedical research, medical and biomedical education and the consumer experience of health. Genetics in Medicine, 2013; 15:824-832 ", "William Tierney": "Chair, Department of Population Health Dell Medical School, Univ of Texas \u2013 Austin President and CEO, Regenstrief Institute (2010-2015) Past President, American Medical Informatics Association Founding Director, AMPATH I never intended to have an academic career, get involved in research, or have a career in biomedical and health informatics (BMHI). Throughout my internal medicine residency, I was planning on entering private practice. As I neared the end of my third year (1979), I didn\u2019t feel ready to practice medicine independently and so became Chief Medicine Resident at Wishard Memorial Hospital, Indianapolis\u2019 tax-supported public teaching hospital. Near the end of that year, the Chief of the Indiana University School of Medicine\u2019s General Internal Medicine, Joe Mamlin, asked me to join the faculty. I happily said yes, expecting to become a clinician- teacher at Wishard. But Joe had other ideas, told me I'd have to do research if I ever wanted to get promoted, and suggested I talk to Clem McDonald who, at the time, was developing and implementing the Regenstrief Medical Record System (RMRS) at Wishard. Although I had no background in computing other than a single Fortran-IV programming course in college, I met with Clem and saw that he was sitting on a gold mine. He was developing, implementing, and studying one of the few electronic health record (EHR) systems in the country, and needed help, especially in implementing and studying his innovations. Having been Chief Resident, I knew everyone in the hospital and knew how to get things done. I was also a curious general internist and salivated at the chance to see what we could learn from Regenstrief\u2019s \u201chuge\u201d data repository, which at the time stored scheduling and visit data, lab and coded imaging study results, and drugs dispensed for an \u201castounding\u201d number of patients (35,000). So in 1980 I joined Clem and Regenstrief Biomedical Informatics second faculty member. We had no formal fellowship program at the time, so Joe allowed me to spend 75% of my time with Clem where he schooled me on the basics of BMHI, clinical database epidemiology, and clinical research, especially how to design, conduct, and publish randomized, controlled trials (RCTs). In addition to protecting my time, Joe also protected Clem: as Chief of Internal Medicine for Wishard, Joe insisted that they implement the systems Clem developed. Which wasn\u2019t easy\u2014Joe once said, \u201cI went to the mat for Clem, and I spent years on that mat.\u201d But it made a difference for Wishard: as a result of its relationship with the Regenstrief Institute, especially its Biomedical Informatics and Health Services Research centers, by the late 1990s Wishard had achieved the lowest severity-adjusted mortality rate of all 92 U.S. public hospitals and was in the top quartile of quality measures and bottom quartile in costs. My first individual project was a relatively straightforward predictive modeling exercise where I identified predictors of hypokalemia (low serum potassium) among 5817 patients treated with diuretics. Completing this project demanded that I learn Regenstrief\u2019s CARE language system used to extract data from the RMRS and to learn \u00ae the tools of data management and analysis, mainly through SAS (SAS Institute, Cary,  NC). Clem\u2019s data manager taught me everything she knew, and then she left. So for eight years I was the sole means of extracting RMRS data for clinical management and research. Eventually, as I got busier, I secured funds to hire a data manager, got her salary covered by grants, and used the initial funds to hire a second data manager, who also became grant supported. In this way, I hired six full-time data managers and launched the Regenstrief Data Core which remains the sole means of extracting data from the RMRS and the statewide health information exchange it spawned, the Indiana Network for Patient Care. When I joined the faculty, Clem was near the end of performing his iconic RCT of computer reminders in which I was originally a subject and became a coinvestigator in 1980. As this study ended in 1982, and while I was developing the Regenstrief Data Core, Clem took a yearlong sabbatical to launch a new biomedical informatics journal, MD Computing. He had received federal funding to perform a follow-up RCT comparing computer reminders, delivered during patient encounters, to retrospective feedback reports. Clem handed the study to me to run and then left on sabbatical. Hence, I had to learn how to conduct and lead a complicated comparison of two informatics interventions in Wishard\u2019s general internal medicine practice by just doing it, kind of like learning how to swim by being thrown off the end of the dock. Yet the experience was invaluable, teaching me how to plan and conduct informatics RCTs in everyday practices. The resulting article reported that immediate reminders outperformed feedback reports and remains one of my most influential articles, having been cited more than 350 times. When Clem returned, he extended the RMRS beyond Wishard\u2019s general and special medicine clinics to store, manage, and report data from all of Wishard\u2019s inpatient and outpatient venues, becoming Wishard\u2019s enterprise EHR. But Clem realized that to have the greatest effect on the processes and outcomes of care, he\u2019d have to be able to interact directly with health care providers while they were making clinical decisions. So he and his team of software engineers developed The Medical Gopher, one of the country\u2019s first computer-based physician order entry (CPOE) systems. Initially implemented in Wishard\u2019s General Medicine Clinic to write only test orders, we proved that physicians could use it effectively and efficiently to write orders. Once fully implemented as the sole means for writing test orders in this general medicine clinic, we then performed a series of RCTs where we showed that redundant outpatient test-ordering could be reduced by displaying (during test ordering) past test results, test prices, and the predicted probability that the test would show the abnormality being tested for. Subsequently, Clem and his developers expanded Gopher to accommodate writing all orders and notes, retrieving RMRS data, and accessing medical knowledge sources. We then designed and implemented the only RCT ever done of hospital-based CPOE use where patients of Gopher users had 13% lower costs, 10.5% shorter hospital stays, and a one-third reduction in drug-related adverse event reports than patients of physicians writing orders on paper. However, Gopher added 33 minutes to interns\u2019 workdays. Following this trial, Gopher was installed in all inpatient and outpatient venues of Wishard Health Services as the only allowable means for writing orders and notes (although dictated notes were still allowed). For the next five years, my career deviated a bit from BMHI as I created Indiana University\u2019s and the Regenstrief Institute\u2019s Center for Health Services and Outcomes Research, although during that time I also became the Founding Director of Regenstrief\u2019s NLM-funded Biomedical Fellowship Program. Then in 1997, NIH\u2019s Fogarty International Center announced a funding opportunity for International Training in Medical Informatics, focusing on developing BMHI expertise in sub-Saharan Africa. I  was asked to apply for this program by leaders of Indiana University\u2019s existing program in western Kenya. I did so, it was funded, and in 1998 I began a 12-year stint as the Director of Informatics and Research for the AMPATH, a collaboration between a number of North American universities, led by Indiana University, with Moi University in Eldoret, Kenya. I convinced a friend and biomedical informaticist from Australia, Terry Hannan, to join me in this endeavor. With his help and that of the Regenstrief Institute and the Kenyan biomedical informatics fellows, in 2000 we created and launched sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s first ambulatory EHR which was used to support primary care and research and significantly reduced both patient and provider time. At the same time, HIV/AIDS was ravaging sub-Saharan Africa, and AMPATH decided to launch a comprehensive screening and treatment program that relied heavily \u00ae on an HIV/AIDS-enhanced EHR. Using MS-Access as a platform, the AMPATH Medical Record System (AMRS) performed well (managing data, generating patient summaries, and generating care reminders) until AMPATH grew to 10,000 patients and 100,000 visit records and slowed to a crawl. Regenstrief faculty developers Paul Biondich and Burke Mamlin (Joe\u2019s son) then recreated the AMRS following the RMRS model which was launched in 2004. This initial system proved highly successful, and subsequently Paul and Burke were joined by Hamish Fraser from Partners in Health and Chris Seebregts from the Medical Research Council of South Africa to transform the AMRS into the open-source OpenMRS. Hamish launched OpenMRS in Rwanda and Haiti while Chris did so in South Africa, and together they supported a community of developers who now have implemented OpenMRS in more than 50 countries. I supported this effort by leading a multinational team that implemented OpenMRS in six Ministry of Health clinics in Tanzania and Uganda. Alas, things evolve. In 2007, Clem retired from Indiana University and the Regenstrief Institute to become the Director of NLM\u2019s Lister Hill Center. I stepped down from my leadership positions in AMPATH to become the Chief of Internal Medicine for Wishard Health Services in 2009 and the President and CEO of the Regenstrief Institute in 2010 where I was a member of the Board of Directors of the Indiana Health Information Exchange and Chairman of the Board of Directors of OpenMRS, Inc. and served for three years as Interim Director of Regenstrief\u2019s Center for Biomedical Informatics. And then, in 2015 I retired from Indiana University and the Regenstrief Institute to become the inaugural Chair of the Department of Population Health at the new Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin. My department\u2019s mission is to enhance the health and wellbeing of the residents of Austin and Central Texas with a particular focus on those suffering health inequities. Doing so requires a wide range of health-related information, hence in addition to divisions of primary care, community engagement, and public health, my department houses the Dell Medical School\u2019s health information and data analytic sciences initiative which will include creating a provider- friendly EHR interface, information management to support value-based care, and a collaborative community-based health information enterprise for Austin and Central Texas. ", "Larry Weed (1923 \u2013 2017)": "By Julie J. McGowan Dr. Larry Weed was already a medical informatics legend when I moved to Vermont in 1991 to take the position of director of the medical library and eventually Associate Dean for Health Sciences Informatics and Library Resources. He had taken an early retirement from the University of Vermont to manage his recently formed company, Problem Knowledge Couplers (PKC), Inc., but I was determined to meet him. Since one of the UVM College of Medicine librarians, Donna O\u2019Malley, had worked with Larry, she said that she would introduce us the next time he visited the campus. In the early 1990\u2019s, it was Larry\u2019s habit to jog from the PKC offices, about a mile away, to the University, running most of the way uphill and backwards. After several months, Donna ran into him and said that I was interested in being introduced. He asked how old I was, and when she said \u201cin her early 40\u2019s,\u201d he stated that he had no interest in meeting me as I was too old to be open to new ideas. My first lengthy meeting with Larry was at the Problem Knowledge Couplers offices the following week where he shared his vision of bringing targeted factoids of knowledge to clinicians at the point of care in a timely and effective way. To accomplish this, he had assembled a team of clinicians, librarians and computer scientists to create patient questionnaires based on the patient\u2019s stated problem. He said that one of the main problems with current medicine is that clinicians are trained either as generalists, in which case they cannot know all of the possible causes of presenting symptoms, or as specialists, in which case they are biased towards making diagnoses that fit their frame of reference rather than considering all of the possible alternatives. The basic premise behind Problem Knowledge Couplers was to bring all that evidence-based information to the clinician to overcome the knowledge \u201cvoltage drop\u201d that frequently occurred in practice. As Larry often commented, the problem with the current medical environment was that patients pick the problem, not the doctors. Larry\u2019s medical informatics career had auspicious beginnings. He received his medical degree from Columbia followed by a residency at Johns Hopkins. His first academic appointment was as an Assistant Professor of Pharmacology and Medicine at Yale where he conducted research in microbial genetics. Although he envisioned a long career in basic science research, his first love, he accepted a position as Director of Medical Education at the Eastern Maine General Hospital in Bangor, ME. This was a pivotal move that impressed upon him the ubiquitous disorganization of patient data and led to the development of SOAP notes and the subsequent Problem Oriented Medical Record (POMR) with problem lists. After 5 years in Bangor Larry again felt the call of basic science research and moved to Case Western Reserve as a post-doc fellow in microbiology followed by an Assistant Professorship. However, three years later, he moved back into clinical medicine as Director of the Outpatient Clinics at Cleveland Metropolitan General Hospital. While he was there he developed a federally funded computerized medical record predicated on  POMR and published his seminal article in the New England Journal of Medicine, \u201cMedical Records that Guide and Teach\u201d (1968). In 1969, Larry moved to the University of Vermont as a Professor of Community Medicine and director of the PROMIS (Problem-Oriented Medical Records Information System) Laboratory. While I was not at UVM during this time, I learned a lot about PROMIS in the early 1990\u2019s when I become one of three designated IT leaders to do a needs-assessment and make recommendations on replacing the home grown electronic medical record system at the state\u2019s largest hospital. The biggest obstacle that we faced was that none of the commercially available systems came close to meeting the functionality of the system developed by Larry in the early 1970\u2019s, including touch screen terminals and the emphasis on the patient\u2019s problem rather than the physician\u2019s data capture. Larry was definitely ahead of his time. During my tenure at UVM, Problem Knowledge Couplers also offered me an opportunity to conduct small research studies on the efficacy of Problem Knowledge Couplers in a variety of areas ranging from their use to mitigate ambiguity in primary care, to assist patients in making a decision about small cell lung carcinoma treatment, to helping determine the ability of elderly patients to remain in their home. Larry was reticent to open his work up to large scale research projects, justifiably because of a variety of confounders that might impact the outcomes, but he knew that I and the Dean of Nursing, my primary research colleague, would consider the issues in an unbiased way. The results of these small case studies, none of which were federally funded but all of which demonstrated the viability of Couplers in certain situations, were published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national meetings. It was frequently exhausting communicating with Larry and many of our encounters happened in the halls of the UVM College of Medicine. One day he was practically running down the hall past my office just as I stepped out. I could tell he was very excited, and he said he had just met with Howard Dean, our Governor who was also an Assistant Professor in the College of Medicine. Because states hold the responsibility for licensure, Larry stated that he had discussed with Howard the possibility of testing physicians on their ability to retrieve evidence for decision-making rather than their knowledge of the changing field as a prerequisite for licensure. As he suggested, with medical knowledge doubling every ten years with a half-life of five, how could anyone expect physicians to keep current with the changing knowledge-base of medicine. He saw computers as a means to manage this knowledge base while physicians could use their considerable skills to elicit information from the patient (both physical and communicated) for much better diagnostic and management decision making predicated on clinical decision support tools. One of Larry\u2019s favorite analogies was that if he were taking a trip across the country, he would rather have a high school student with him who knew how to read a map (or a good GPS) than someone with a Ph.D. in geography. Larry was a visionary for the health care environment. However, it was his focus on humanity that made him a truly Renaissance man. He read and absorbed the writings of many philosophers; his discussions were often punctuated by quotes from the philosophic literature. A prolific author, his writings were a skillful balance of scientific knowledge and the concepts of the great thinkers of the past. Although I knew I would miss our challenging conversations, after nine years in Vermont, my career took me to Indiana University and the Regenstrief Institute, but I still called Vermont home and kept in touch with Larry.  Although a \u201cflat-lander,\u201d as someone not native born is called, Larry was a true Vermonter, with all of what that entails. When Larry was in his late 80\u2019s and I needed to visit to do an oral history on behalf of the National Library of Medicine project, there was three feet of snow on the ground, but Larry made a special effort to shovel his drive so my car wouldn\u2019t get stuck. In his Underhill house overlooking Vermont\u2019s highest mountain, we talked not just about the future of medicine but also about the philosophical underpinnings of the human condition. He saw quality medical care being predicated on a partnership between the physician and the patient, enhance by the ability of the computer to manage the growing medical knowledge base that human cognition could not. My last conversations with Larry occurred several weeks before his death. I wanted to nominate him for the ACMI Collen Award for his incredible career in medical informatics. Always thinking about the future of the profession he loved and to which he contributed so much, he said that the award should go to one of the younger informaticians who would be able to leverage it for the betterment of patient-centered care. He continued that the greatest \u201caward\u201d that he could receive would be a national adoption of the Coupler concept, supported by the National Library of Medicine, to take health care into the future. Larry has truly left an incredible legacy, not just for medical informatics but for the future of health care. He was a visionary who was probably one of the most humble men I have ever met. Robert Frost, Vermont\u2019s great poet, wrote a poem entitled \u201cThe Road Not Taken\u201d and in thinking back over Larry\u2019s life, it would be hard to imagine our profession without his many contributions if Larry had devoted all of his energies to a basic science research career. There is no doubt he would have excelled in that as well, but our profession would not have had the benefit of one of the true pioneers in the organization of medical knowledge, the development of electronic medical records, the early creation of clinical decision support, and the focus on patient-centered care, all reinforced by a fabric of a deep understanding the human condition. Journal of Participatory Medicine, 2013; 5:e13 ", "Gio Wiederhold": "Spanning MIS History: From Chief Programmer for UC California to system building, DARPA Program Manager and ending as Professor emeritus of Computer Science at Stanford University Early: My background is much less academic than that most of my colleagues. By late 1961 I had about four years of computing experience\u2014then a rare commodity\u2014having worked for NATO (starting as a computer\u2014as in the 2016 movie Hidden Figures) in Holland and later for IBM in New York. The most challenging project was determining the propulsive capability (specific impulse) of solid rocket fuels, a contract IBM had with the just founded ARPA. The work led to my first publication. When IBM installed a 32K 704 in their new plant in San Jose, larger than any machine IBM had on the east coast, our project was transferred there. I took some time out to attend computing seminars at UC Berkeley. UC: I was hired in 1961 to be the Chief Programmer for the University of California (UC). They had obtained a double-memory IBM 7090, a machine obviously large enough to serve all of the university's campuses, including their medical schools in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Many projects touched on biology. Edward Feigenbaum had come from Carnegie to the School of Business with his EPAM concept learning program, written in IPL/V, a language that I can best describe now as an assembly-language level form of LISP. Professor Robert Tryon, in Psychology, developed cluster analysis programs, supporting his experiments that demonstrated that trained behavioral traits can be inherited\u2014at least in rats. At UCSF, Dr. John Starkweather was developing the instructional language, PILOT (Programmed Instruction for Learning or Teaching). Computing at UC, even without a dedicated department attracted wonderful students and staff and showed the breadth of candidate applications. At UC Berkeley\u2019s Electrical Engineering department, an SDS 930 was used in by Harry Huskey and David Evans (later founding the Evans Sutherland graphic systems business) for developing time- sharing, allowing more than one user program to run on one machine. Soon after UCLA was chosen as the base for the Western Data Processing Center (WDPC) to serve other schools in Southern California. Another system came to UCLA\u2019s Medical school, where the BMD statistical package was being developed. My focus was then reduced to serving UC Berkeley and the UC San Francisco medical school. The prime language was FORTRAN. The IBM-provided compiler\u2014I had worked on at IBM\u2014generated very efficient programs but had to load itself in 4 phases from tape, so that even a null program would take a couple of minutes to compile. To serve the UC student population we developed a compiler that could stay in one 32K memory bank of the 7090 memory and compile and run the modestly sized student programs rapidly. We also had an early 5 Mbyte RAMAC disk system. Since the RAMAC had only two heads for all of its 50 24\" platters it was to slow for swapping running programs in and out. The FORFOR system collected students card sets in batches for fast execution. Some of these concepts were extended in our later work at Stanford's medical school.  Even as a professional, the time I spent at UC Berkeley was a great learning experience. I made many contacts that I maintain to this date, although they are diminishing. In April 2017 we went to Professor Harry Huskey's memorial service in th Santa Cruz. A year earlier we had attended his 100 birthday. India: In 1964 Prof. Huskey offered me to follow up on his work in setting up the operation and teaching of computing at the Indian Institute of Technology at Kanpur (IIT-K) in India. The school was set up by consortium of 5 US universities, funded from US AID. I was there for a year, starting November 1962. But that is a story I will skip. While in India I was offered positions on my return at the Computer Centers at Princeton, directed then by Ed McCluskey, a pioneer in Computer Reliability research and at Stanford, where Ed Feigenbaum had just joined the founding faculty of its Computer Science department. I chose Stanford, with the provision that I would also be a lecturer in the new department, which, at the time, due its Math department origin, was part of the school of Humanities and Sciences. ACME: Joshua Lederberg, a Nobel Laureate, had founded the department of Genetics at Stanford in 1958. His interests ranged wide, including contamination of earth by material returned from space, which led to an active collaboration with NASA, and computing in medicine. Lederberg had used access to the AN/FSQ-32 computer at SDC in Santa Monica to learn about computing, programming in LISP. Those large systems were to replace the earlier vacuum tube AN/FSQ-7s of the SAGE US Air Defense system, and even to interoperate with the FAA for Air Traffic Control. The project became unmanageable and was cancelled as threats of a nuclear attack on the US diminished. The one operational computer was taken on by ARPA and made available to a few researchers via a novel technology: AT&T 150 baud modems. Lederberg, with Ed Feigenbaum, obtained NIH funding to set up a computing facility with real-time data access to medical experiments at Stanford Medical School. Ed Feigenbaum named it ACME (Advanced Computing for Medical Experiments). So, late in 1965, I became the Director of a non- existing Medical Computing Center. Hardware, software, and communication had to be specified, designed as needed, and built. Convenient and reliable access by medical faculty was a prime criterion. Timeshared access was to be mediated by a new compiler and language: PL/ACME. I convinced several of the best UC Berkeley staff to join me and exploit the experience gained there. We used the specification of PL/1, a language specification intended to combine scientific\u2014Fortran style\u2014and commercial\u2014COBOL style\u2014computing, defined by an IBM-sponsored committee. Voy Jew, soon Wiederhold, who I had met at Berkeley many years earlier, wrote a manual and taught regular short courses. Remote typewriter terminals were connected by operator-switched wiring throughout the medical school building, since up to 1968 Bell telephone did not allow use of telephone connection other than via their costly modem equipment. I did install a modem at our home in Woodside, many early medical researchers have visited us there. Since I bought the house from the former fire chief I also had it used to maintain the call list for the local volunteer fire brigade, likely another first. ACME used what was at that time an outrageous amount of memory, adding initially 1 and later 2 Megabtyte units, each delivered carefully by truck from the East Coast, to support the real-time aspects and memory-resident programs. A number of publications came out of that work, but the general computer science community did not follow work in medical applications, and health care was not seen as a fertile area for applications in 1970. We also taught courses on applying computers to medicine to external groups, some sponsored by IMIA's predecessor, TC- 4 of IFIP.  Data acquisition created voluminous and complex data files. Researchers and physicians needed help in organizing such data so we developed a database system (TOD \u2013 Time-Oriented Database), which now would be called a column store. A major application was Prof. Jim Fries' immunology data, which led to many of clinical results. Ted Shortliffe arrived on the scene as a student as the ACME project was being closed. I continued working on various on-line and data systems projects, consulting and at Stanford hospital. UCSF: I didn't have a PhD, nor a BS or MS, at the time. Jim Warren, an active promoter of personal computer technology who lived near us and had taken one of my classes at Stanford, told me that UCSF was starting a program in Medical Information Science. I collected my Dutch high school records, my publications, and some important recommendations from the medical computing community and was admitted in 1973 to the University of California in San Francisco. My primary advisor at UCSF was John Starkweather, which gave me an illustrious academic ancestry back to Galileo and his mentors, including many medical sages and mathematicians, as Hermann Boerhaave, Louis Agassiz (the advisor of the Stanford's first President, David Starr Jordan) and William James, whose theory contributed to the concept of perceptrons. I was also advised by Ronald Henley, Marsden Blois, and John Dervin. Medical databases were an obvious topic. With Ron Henley I wrote a proposal for NCHSR to survey the growing and diverse field of data systems used in Ambulatory Health Care. Such data have a longer life, diverse sources, and divergent purposes, making their study especially interesting. Bolstered by six outside experts we visited as a group about 20 sites that were involved in medical record systems and obtained a good overview of the issues in the field. The study report became an important appendix to my thesis. I started writing a textbook on Database Design, which also became an appendix to the thesis. Soon after John Dervin and Jonathan Rodnick, practicing at the Family Practice Center Santa Rosa obtained a grant to test the effects of having computers in their setting. Some of the former ACME bunch installed computers in two of the three patient care rooms. Both computers presented data from their medical records, but one also allowed data entry. It provided some useful three-way comparisons, although those computing services did not provide enough trustworthy data for a formal clinical application analysis. Those systems validated the performance equations I presented in the database book. In the end, my thesis was only 130 pages, with three appendices, each over a 1000 pages. Stanford CSD: being a freshly minted but 40-year old PhD, I looked for a suitable academic position. I received several attractive tentative offers, although an advertised position at Stanford appeared to be intended for a well-known CS author, so that I did not apply there. I did ask many Stanford colleagues for recommendations. Then, late in the summer, Ed Feigenbaum told me that the expected candidate did not work out. I gathered all the recommendations, applied, and was appointed as an assistant professor in the topic of Distributed Systems. Databases were not an academic topic then. I tried to be a good regular professor, had some great students, and was able to get several grants to support me, students, and access to computers. I focused on databases and started a course. I proposed to apply AI techniques to databases and coined the term for such work: Knowledge-based systems (KBMS). I did not become a great teacher, sometimes being frustrated with the material and systems I had to use for established courses I was obligated to cover. When it became time for a tenure decision, I was able to switch and become a Research Professor. Stanford gives a Research Professors most of the rights of tenure-line faculty, but limits the number of research faculty to a small fraction of the regular faculty. No full slot was available, but getting a joint appointment with Medicine,  where Ted Shortliffe had initiated a program in Medical Information Science (MIS), solved the problem. Now I was able to teach what I wanted, and support myself otherwise by research. I was able to bring in external faculty in for related topics, as Distributed Databases, topic that is now part of Stanford's regular curriculum. Covering computing- oriented sections of MIS courses, I supervised a number of PhDs and MS students. In 1981 Don Lindberg encouraged me to publish a book on Databases for Healthcare, exploiting what I had learned on NLM and NIH committees. Later I contributed to Ted Shortliffe's Medical Informatics book. I am disappointed that its later editions omit the chapter on Hospital Systems, which remain a crucial and costly, although from researchers\u2019 point-of-view boring and contentious component of health care delivery. ARPA: I was offered a stint as Program Manager in Washington, and took a leave from Stanford from 1991 to 1994 and was able to initiate the Intelligent Integration of Information (I3) program, and fund work combining database technology, and information sharing using AI-based mediation to resolve semantic conflicts. The public- visible portion became the Digital Library Initiative (DLI), managed and partially supported by NSF. That remains an area where much is to be done, although spinoffs from that funding, as Google, have achieved much prominence. Back at Stanford: Upon my return conflict-of-interest concerns meant that I could not get DLI funding. Instead I did research in software integration and reactive security approaches to prevent leaks. In 1997, when NLM joined the DLI program I was able to get some funding for security research. Some results were used commercially in pharmaceutical companies but have not found much traction. The problem is that preventing leaks implies a failure to protect entry by hackers, a possibility that vendors of security software hate to admit, even though experience shows otherwise. I did little work in Healthcare after that. I have a major problem that using computers in Healthcare will induces rigor mortis of a system that is broken. While physicians remain responsible for all their actions they cannot afford to trust results that health care systems provide\u2014if data is missing or false, they are responsible for any resulting problems. Vendors are completely absolved from responsibility. Now benefits of sharing information and minimizing treatments are a chimera. Redundant treatments are a benefit to the participants. Pharmaceutical companies negotiate with provider systems, giving deep discounts, but these discounts are not available to the US government or individuals. Schemes for reduced prices to indigent individuals create tax savings that exceed drug costs. A single-payer health care system will not help here. Retirement: After my formal retirement in 2001 I was able to contribute to halting an outrageous patent troll, who was picking off healthcare system providers one-by-one, until Anthem was willing to invest in a costly, multi-year fight. Most of my other consulting deals now with valuing intellectual property, an export issue that government agencies find hard to address although the effects are clear. Pharmas are a major player. My most recent book, Valuing Intellectual Capital (Springer 2013) describes the methods and makes recommendations\u2014most are unlikely to be accepted by politicians. "}
