{"Jos Aarts": "Professor Emeritus Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands A winding path in a meandering landscape The early \u201980\u2019s were a bad time for academics. It was hard to find a job, even for physicists. The options were limited: education or something with computers. I found a position as a teacher of medical physics in a school of nursing. The director of the school asked me whether I could teach about the use of computers in healthcare. He had heard that computers were increasingly being used in hospitals. Yes, I could do that. Educated as a physicist, I had been using computers to analyze the data that I got from my experiments in low temperature physics. I was the owner and solver of my own experimental data problems, so I wrote programs that incorporated fast fourier transforms to analyze signals and look for periodicity. As Jan van Bemmel observed, it was a time when science and computing were intimately connected in the hands of a single person. There was no academic computer science program at the time in Dutch universities; they only were established in the early \u201990s. A good science or engineering background and hands-on experience in programming was the pathway into what is now called informatics. The way to learn about computers in medicine was to network with people who knew about the subject. Jan van Bemmel was such a person, and moreover, he was very welcoming to people who wanted to learn. I visited him in 1983 when he was still a professor at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. In 1987, he would become professor at Erasmus University Rotterdam. He introduced me to his work, but also to his co-workers. In this period, I taught and developed health informatics courses. In 1984, I made my first trip to the United States and laid the groundwork for a large network of colleagues in this field. Already in my teaching I emphasized the need to involve end-users in the implementation of health information technology (HIT). When I moved in 1986 to a faculty position at Hogeschool Utrecht, I was given the opportunity to develop a post- graduate course for nurses that focused on opportunities that HIT could offer to innovate nursing practices. In 1988, I joined the Department of Medical Informatics of Erasmus University as a visiting researcher to acquaint myself with research on electronic health records. At the same time, I realized that medical informatics still had the characteristics of a laboratory science. Applications were developed and studied, but hardly evaluated in practice. Though I was not aware of his work, Henry Lundsgaarde already wrote in 1987 that medical expert systems were not evaluated in clinical environments. The claim that medical informatics could contribute to the quality of health, could hardly be substantiated. After my stay as visiting researcher at Erasmus, I took a position as senior lecturer at Fontys Hogescholen in Eindhoven with the task to develop a model curriculum for health informatics for Dutch professional schools of health care, including nursing and physiotherapy, and related learning materials. This was a large government funded project that involved collaboration between different schools. My time in  Eindhoven allowed me to think more about the impact of health technology in practice and how to translate such ideas in education and research. Let me be clear, I was not alone or the first who was thinking along these lines. In the United States next to Henry Lundsgaarde, Bonnie Kaplan, Nancy Lorenzi, and Diana Forsythe were addressing similar questions. In 1993, after an international conference in Cincinnati hosted by Nancy Lorenzi, the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) recognized that human and organizational issues were important and approved a new working group on organizational issues (IMIA WG 13, Organizational Impact of Medical Informatics). About the same time the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) established the People and Organizational Issues Working Group. In 1996 the European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) approved my proposal to establish a working group on human and organizational issues. The initial emphasis of the working groups was on organizational change. Human behavior was seen as a barrier to adopting new technologies, and therefore healthcare professionals needed to be prepared to accept these. Change management was the buzzword. It meant an initial focus on behavioral change and diffusion of technology studies in medical informatics. Evaluation was considered a related, but yet separate domain and that was reflected in the establishment of separate evaluation working groups in IMIA and EFMI. As a result, a number of meetings were held to scope research and methods. Having experience in curriculum development I took the initiative for a master\u2019s degree in health information management, emphasizing the need of training professionals who would be able to implement health information in complex organizations. I worked together with Graham Wright and Victor Peel from the University of Manchester, who evaluated a number of informatics implementations in the United Kingdom to realize the program. The master\u2019s degree program started as a collaboration between the University of Manchester, University of Surrey and Fontys Hogescholen and later continued as a collaboration between the University of Surrey and Erasmus University Rotterdam. Still at Fontys Hogescholen I was invited to study the implementation of a new computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system in the Radboud University Hospital in Nijmegen. The study would be based on interviews, observations and implementation documents, but social science methods and theory was also needed. It was fortunate that in 1995 through a mutual acquaintance I met Marc Berg, who got his PhD at Maastricht University with a thesis about the relation between rationalized medicine and clinical decision support systems. He provided me with the right theoretical knowledge and skills that I needed to make sense of my study. It was the sociotechnical approach that would guide my scientific work from that moment. The sociotechnical approach aims at understanding how new health information technology is developed, introduced, and becomes a part of social practices and uses this understanding to improve technology. The implementation in Nijmegen did not succeed, but my study showed how the interrelatedness of social environment, people and technology determined the outcome. When Marc Berg moved to Erasmus University in 1999, he asked me to join and set up health informatics education and research at the Institute of Health Policy and Management. Under his supervision I received in 2005 my PhD degree with a thesis about sociotechnical understanding of CPOE systems in Dutch and American hospitals. During my thesis work I was able to work together with Joan Ash, who at the Oregon Health & Science University in Portland had established a CPOE study group. I benefited from her empirical knowledge of CPOE systems in the United States. In this way electronic drug prescribing and medication safety became part of my research work. At Erasmus, we thought that there was room to bring together researchers in the domain of people and  organizational issues and we decided to organize in 2001 a conference \u201cInformation Technology in Health Care: Sociotechnical Approaches\u201d, which became a series of conferences, held every three years, related to IMIA\u2019s MEDINFO congresses. The conference merged with the human factors meetings, becoming a two-year event under the auspices of IMIA working groups. I think that through this series and our publications the term \u201csociotechnical systems\u201d became accepted in medical informatics. A quick search of PubMed shows 110 references with \u201csociotechnical\u201d in the journal title between 1998, when Marc Berg published his first article, and 2016. \u201cSociotechnical system\u201d became also a key concept in the Institute of Medicine\u2019s report on safety of health information technology. At Erasmus University I continued work on electronic prescribing, medication safety and medical workflows through my PhD students Heleen van der Sijs and Zahra Niazkhani, which led to a number of publications in medical informatics journals. I especially mention the work with Heleen van der Sijs about drug safety alerts, in which we both explored theoretical issues surrounding how clinicians interact with alerts and conduct studies in naturalistic settings. Studying health information technology with a sociotechnical lens remains contested in a scientific domain that is shaped in the scientific tradition of testing hypotheses, obtaining replicable results and publishing generalizable conclusions. Initially the people and organizational issues emphasized the need for change management to improve user acceptance through research and education. Now the sociotechnical perspective celebrates the complexity of technology and its social context, and is less normative. In 2012, I was elected Fellow of the American College of Medical Informatics, which I consider as an honor for my work at the intersection of biomedical informatics and the social sciences. I consider myself a biomedical informatician, who applies social science research methods to capture the complexity of health information technology in organizational contexts. I continue my research, but I realize that the time is coming to pass the baton to a new generation of researchers and educators in the rich field studying the social dimensions of biomedical informatics. ", "William (Bud) Abbott (1931 \u2013 2011)": "By Barry Barber & Maureen Scholes William (Bud) Abbott was an East End lad, a wartime pilot, a financial wizard, an all- around computer expert, a sensitive manager, an international medical informatician, a distinguished member of The Royal London Hospital staff, a Regional Health Authority trouble-shooter, a senior member of the British Computer Society and a leading light in the International Medical Informatics Association as well as a pillar of the Hartland community. He was a really trustworthy and reliable friend giving sensible, down to earth advice in times of difficulty. He was exceedingly well read, knowledgeable and expert in so many different fields \u2013 from all walks of life people come up and say how much he has helped them in their careers and their personal lives. The bible tells us that \"In my father's house, there are many mansions\" \u2013 here on earth there seem to be so many different mansions and Bud Abbott was at home in all of them with a helping hand to all who lived there. Bud was a member of the Finance Department under David Sherren, who thought very highly of him as a young man, and who gave him the opportunity of carrying out a systems analysis of the department with a view to computerisation as the existing punched card systems no longer provided the required flexibility \u2013 at least some of his design proposals were thought out when he was quite seriously ill in a hospital bed. This work was added to proposals for scientific and medical work to provide the basis on which The London Hospital bought it\u2019s Elliott 803 computer in November 1964 \u2013 the first hospital in the country to purchase its own computer. This computer used fast 5- hole paper tape readers and printers, which we subsequently found had been developed during the war at Bletchley Park. About this time he and I, Barry Barber, became Directors of the Computer and Operational Research Units at the hospital \u2013 long before the NHS thought about Directors! Our work took us into all aspects of hospital life \u2013 including eating in the Sisters\u2019 Dining Room where they were happy to tell us about the problems that they had encountered with the computer! These were the early, pioneering days before computers were generally available and when the problems of data input had yet to be solved and working with keyboards was considered to be beneath the dignity of doctors and nurses. Three years of enthusiastic work, an efficiently running finance system, programming all sorts of scientific, medical and operational research problems enabled us to develop our ideas for what we called a \u201cPatient Administration System\u201d for the hospital. This was envisaged as laying the basic foundation for the flow of patients through the hospital, who they were, where they were, what arrangements were being made for them \u2013 i.e., getting the \u201cnuts and bolts\u201d right before we started developing a fully fledged \u201cMedical Record System\u201d. We did not want to kill anyone by getting their records wrong while we were working out the new ways of handling the basic administration!  Around this time the Department of Health and Social Security was anxious to explore the possibilities of using \u201cReal Time\u201d computing techniques for improving hospital activities. The Board of Governors of The London Hospital allowed us to explore the opportunities for collaboration with the DHSS, setting up a \u201cComputer Executive\u201d to control and take responsibility for this work. The Executive comprised Michael Fairey [the Deputy House Governor], Robert Cohen [Professor of Medicine], Maureen Scholes [Senior Assistant Matron] together with Bud Abbott [Director of Computing] and Barry Barber [Director of Operational Research]. As work progressed, the Chairman, Sir Harry Moore, provided us with a 1969 paper from his computer experts at Hill Samuels entitled \u201cWhat Went Wrong? An Analysis of Mistakes in Data Processing Management\u201d. He indicated that while we could not guarantee success, he did not expect us to fail for any of the reasons set out in that paper! Subsequent history is littered with computer systems that have failed for many of the reasons that were identified so long ago. We worked hard on the project deciding that we should try to develop a basic system for the hospital as a whole rather than a pilot system in a small area \u2013 this immediately required 46 terminals for the wards and departments. We wanted a system that would be available as close to 24 hours a day and 7 days as week as we could achieve and we wanted it to be usable by all our doctors, nurses, clerks and administrators. Also, it had to be able to handle our rather high peak computing loads. We developed a \u201cFeasibility Study\u201d during 1968 and the \u201cInvitation to Tender\u201d in 1969 and there was much subsequent discussion about the choice of computer system as a result of the government\u2019s \u201cBuy British\u201d policy. Eventually we were able to install a Univac 418/III computer system with fast message switching capabilities in March 1971. We had organised full time on-site maintenance and the systems analysts, programmers and computer operators were full time hospital staff \u2013 all responsive to the hospital\u2019s requirements rather than to an outside commercial firm. The Computer Executive held whole day general education sessions at the top of the Alexandra School of Nursing for consultants, heads of departments and senior nurses \u2013 and we only missed out on one consultant! For each of the areas to be handled by the computer system we held training sessions for the staff using a model of the proposed system. The system that was developed handled waiting lists, admissions and discharges, the patient index, laboratory and x-ray requests and reports and nursing personnel information. Curiously, the basic software lasted for nearly 36 years running on 3 different computer platforms before it was taken out of service and replaced by the current NHS computer technology. Throughout Bud Abbott\u2019s calm leadership saw us all through many difficulties and challenges \u2013 he was indeed a remarkable and much loved man. Once the system had been established, Michael Fairey, Bud Abbott and Barry Barber migrated to the North East Thames Regional Health Authority after the 1974 \u201cNHS Reforms\u201d while Robert Cohen and Maureen Scholes continued to support the system at The Royal London Hospital. ", "Klaus-Peter Adlassnig": "Computer Science in Dresden/East Germany & Vienna/Austria Prof. of Medical Informatics at Medical University of Vienna Guest Prof. at Stanford, Berkeley, Meiji/Japan & MIT Editor-in-Chief of AI in Medicine & Founder of Medexter My Professional Life: Between Worlds My background. My father was Austrian, my mother German. I was born in Zittau, Germany, in 1950. At the time, Zittau was part of the German Democratic Republic (GDR; East Germany). From birth, I was an Austrian in the GDR. I attended school in Zittau (ten-class general educational polytechnic secondary school, as it was called), completed high school (abitur) and a combined apprenticeship in electromechanics in Frankfurt an der Oder, and then started my studies in computer science at the Technical University of Dresden in 1970. In those years, I began reading the scientific and technical literature. I found science fiction written, for instance, by the Polish author Stanis\u0142aw Lem (1921\u20132006) extremely absorbing, creative, and inspiring. Not only was his technical fantasy based on scientific evidence, but also his illustration of utopian worlds influenced me very deeply. Quite a few years later, I also came to appreciate the descriptions of dystopian worlds by the U.S. science fiction writer Philip K. Dick (1928\u201382). My studies in Dresden, East Germany. The computer did what you programmed it to do. I liked this, and consequently was inspired by my computer science studies! The year I began university studies, 1970, was the second year that courses in what was then called information processing were being taught at the Technical University of Dresden. We learned a lot about mathematics, statistics, physics, formal languages and automata, computer languages (machine code, ALGOL 60 and 68), operating systems, systems theory and\u2014last but not least\u2014we had to study Russian and English. We also attended compulsory classes on Marxism and Leninism, as well as lectures on political systems theory. Millennia-old philosophical questions such as \u201cWhat came first\u2014matter or mind?\u201d or \u201cCan the world\u2014in principle\u2014be understood?\u201d were addressed in these classes. I found these interesting but was averse to the politics of the time and its lopsided and pseudo-scientific, often erroneous arguments. During my first year of these studies, I also attended lectures on cybernetics. We were taught to apply systems analysis approaches from cybernetics not only to technical and biological but also to societal systems (such as socialism in the GDR). These attempts did not yield the desired political conclusions. As a result, cybernetics was deleted from the computer science curriculum. Nevertheless, I was already, say, infected by the ideas behind cybernetic feedback circuits and the possibilities of unintended network consequences. At the same time, I came in contact with a research group focused on pattern recognition. We programmed what were known as adaptive threshold units, which are closely related to artificial neural networks. Programming was done in ALGOL 60. This group also collaborated with the Institute of Pathology, Medical Academy of Dresden (now a part of the Technical University of Dresden). At the end of the third year of study, a three-month practical training period was prescribed by the curriculum. I completed this at the Institute of Pathology, focusing on a computational aspect of image  processing: calculating the ratios between cell protoplasm and nuclei in microscopic images of mouse tissues. One day in 1973, we had the opportunity to witness an interesting and rare event in the autopsy room. A dead orangutan from the zoo in Dresden was brought in. The autopsy was performed in order to identify the cause of death. It was difficult to stay in the autopsy room: the odor was almost unbearable but made you aware of your senses. However, during the three months of my practical training, all elements of my subsequent professional life\u2014namely computer science, research, and medicine\u2014came together, forming my professional identity and paving the way for my future endeavors. Unfortunately, despite my interest and enthusiasm, I was unable to continue working on such interdisciplinary research and medicine. As research, in the GDR, fell under increasingly stringent political controls, I was told I would be unable to pursue my research any longer. Being a citizen of Austria, I was not permitted to enter research institutions or even computer centers. Austria belonged to the Western hemisphere and the GDR to the socialist block. However, I was able to complete my studies and submit an MSc thesis in 1974 on a computer program for teaching Boolean logic. In 1975, I finally decided to move to Vienna, which I was able to do legally. At the Department of Medical Computer Sciences, University of Vienna Medical School, Austria. I arrived in Vienna and needed a job, ideally in research. I went to all of the universities, academies, and other research institutions in Vienna and its vicinity (there are many!) but did not find a suitable position. I then decided to join Siemens Austria as a programmer. We programmed in two-address machine code. This was a great job! Later, in mid-1976, I received a phone call from Professor Georg Grabner (1923\u2013 2006), who remembered me from my interview when I first arrived in Vienna. He spoke to me about a job as a systems analyst at the Department of Medical Computer Sciences of the University of Vienna Medical School. Professor Grabner was not only the head of Medical Computer Sciences but also the head of the Second University Clinic for Gastroenterology and Hepatology. In essence, he was a clinician, but he was also a far- sighted, progressive, future-oriented individual who recognized the need for computer applications in clinical medicine. I started to work on September 1, 1976 and was permitted not only to work as a systems analyst at the computer center of the Department of Medical Computer Sciences, but also to pursue research on this subject. My aim was to write a PhD thesis. CADIAG\u2014Computer-Assisted Diagnosis in Internal Medicine. The Department of Medical Computer Sciences, with its access to clinicians of the Second University Clinic of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, had started excellent work on computer- assisted diagnosis as early as 1968. Clinicians, together with mathematicians and statisticians, developed logical models for computer-assisted diagnosis in internal medicine, based on the seminal paper by Robert S. Ledley (1926\u20132012) and Lee B. Lusted (1922\u201394) on \u201cReasoning Foundations of Medical Diagnosis\u201d published in Science in 1959. After contemplating the then predominant two-valued logical approaches to medical data and clinical knowledge models, I developed a three-valued logic system (symptoms and diagnoses are present, absent, or not tested/unknown) based on Kleene\u2019s ternary logic. I found later that the ubiquitous unsharpness in the \u201cboundaries\u201d of linguistic medical terms (denoting concepts such as fever, leukopenia, or hypoxemia) could best be formally defined by fuzzy sets. Fuzzy logic would then be able to propagate the  calculated fuzzy logic values through a diagnostic inference network suggested and \u201cestablished\u201d by experts. Together with clinicians from the Second University Clinic of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, but especially the rheumatology specialist Professor Gernot Kolarz, we started to develop medical knowledge bases for differential diagnosis in internal medicine: for clinical rheumatology with Professor Kolarz; hepatology with Professor Grabner; gall bladder and bile duct diseases, and pancreatic diseases with Professor Werner Scheithauer, and others. We collected an extensive body of data from actual patients, carried out accuracy studies, developed symptom and disease ontologies, programmed knowledge base consistency checking methods, and much more. These differential diagnostic consultation systems were named CADIAG. The process of development extended from 1976 to 2010. And maybe it has not ended yet! My exposure to fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic. Immediately after I discovered fuzzy set theory and logic in 1977, I started to develop fuzzy models for representing medical data and clinical knowledge. I redesigned the three-valued logic CADIAG system and extended it using fuzzy logic methods. Fuzzy sets, and later fuzzy logic, were developed by Professor Lotfi A. Zadeh (1921\u20132017), from the Computer Science Division, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California (UC), Berkeley, U.S.A. I presented my PhD thesis in computer science at the Vienna University of Technology in 1983, titled \u201cA computer-assisted diagnostic system using fuzzy subsets\u201d. Since my arrival in Vienna, I had established close relationships with the informatics departments of the Vienna University of Technology, especially Professor Manfred Brockhaus, with whom we also started teaching medical informatics in Vienna. He was my PhD supervisor. Teaching Medical Informatics. When I once visited the Vienna University of Technology to attend a class on database systems delivered by Professor Brockhaus, he invited me for a cup of coffee and proposed that we jointly develop a small curriculum for Applied Medical Informatics that would be available to his technical students. The aim was a collaborative project between the University of Vienna Medical School and the Vienna University of Technology. We included Professor Grabner and then prepared a comprehensive program consisting of topics related to medicine and medical informatics for informatics students. This was the beginning of medical informatics studies not only in Vienna, but also in all of Austria! My post-doc at the Computer Science Division, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, U.S.A. In the course of my work on CADIAG-2 (or FuzzyCADIAG), the differential diagnostic consultation system for internal medicine applying fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic, I started to exchange letters with Professor Lotfi A. Zadeh, asking for technical literature and advice. As a result of our correspondence, he invited me to visit the Computer Science Division, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, UC Berkeley, U.S.A., as a post-doc, deepen my knowledge of fuzzy methods, and share my research with them. I actually had to apply twice for a fellowship from the Max Kade Foundation in New York, NY, U.S.A., awarded by the Austrian Academy of Sciences, in order to finance the trip and period of residence, and to be able to take my wife Christine with me. My post-doc time at UC Berkeley (including extensions) lasted from 1984 to 1986. From the very beginning, we enjoyed the warmth and friendliness of Lotfi and his wife Fay.  Medical expert systems, clinical decision support, and running my own institute. Upon my return from Berkeley in 1986, I began a long phase of developing medical expert and knowledge-based systems for internal medicine, laboratory test interpretation, intensive care, and infection control. I intensified my contact with clinicians and the hospital administration, delivered classes on medical expert systems and fuzzy set theory, and supervised many MSc and PhD students, both from the Vienna University of Technology and the University of Vienna Medical School. At the time, I was already the head of a Section (Institute) on Medical Expert and Knowledge-Based Systems at the Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics and Intelligent Systems of the Medical University of Vienna. Stimulated by developments in the U.S.A., I renamed my own profession clinical informatics, and myself a clinical informatician. This was to emphasize the direct patient-care-oriented work of our medical informatics research and development. Editor-in-Chief of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine. My service as Editor-in- Chief extended from 2002 to the end of 2016: a period of 15 years. It was an extremely interesting but also time-consuming activity. We (the Editorial Office headed by Dipl.- Ing. Andrea Rappelsberger and myself) started with about 80 submissions per year in 2002. This number grew to approximately 350 by 2016. CEO of Medexter Healthcare. Medexter Healthcare was founded in 2002. Medexter Healthcare is dedicated to the development and global marketing of innovative software systems for decision support with proven clinical usefulness. After its inception, Medexter has succeeded in establishing technical platforms and clinical decision support systems for a number of hospitals, commercial partners, and medical and teaching institutions. Retirement and activities now. I retired from the Medical University of Vienna at the end of September 2015. However, I continued as Editor-in-Chief of the international journal Artificial Intelligence in Medicine until the end of 2016, still supervise MSc and PhD students, and now continue to work fulltime on software systems for clinical decision support with Medexter Healthcare. Furthermore, I am very interested in the state and future impact of AI, especially in clinical medicine, in philosophical questions as to what computers can or cannot do usefully, safely, and ethically, and in processes of societal development in my immediate vicinity and also worldwide. I do hope these developments follow evolutionary paths towards humanistic, non-violent futures. Yes, several, possibly different ones! Why not? ", "Ab Bakker": "Professor, University of Leiden IMIA Vice President and Treasurer During my studies at the Free University at Amsterdam (Mathematics and physics), I started to work part-time at the National Aeronautical Laboratory. One of the earliest computers was introduced here in 1957. The phenomenon of the computer and its applications drew my interest and that remains so until now. From 1960-1967, I was responsible at the Netherlands Shipmodel Basin at Wageningen where I initiated and led the computer centre that had 3 main tasks: 1. Processing the experimental data gathered in the institute 2. Carry out complicated calculations for shipyards all over the world 3. Performing hydrodynamic research computations. This work led to my thesis in 1969 at Delft Technical University. From 1967-1971 I worked for the Philips Computer Company where I was responsible for scientific and special applications. In September 1971 I received an appointment at Leiden University for carrying out research in medical biological information processing, while also assuming the responsibility for the computer department at Leiden University Hospital, most importantly for the development of an experimental integrated hospital information system. Research of the faculty department focused on signal analysis, pattern recognition, image processing and information systems. The project for an experimental integrated hospital information system was sponsored by the Dutch government from 1972 to 1976, and resulted in an operational system for the university hospital. Because other hospitals were interested in the system the BAZIS foundation was set-up for the further development and the support of the HIS (often referred to as the Leyden University Hospital Information System). My first contacts with foreign colleagues in medical informatics was during a meeting at Toulouse, France - journ\u00e9es d\u2019informatique medical. In conjunction with these confrences there was an initiative by Fran\u00e7ois Begon to create a World Association for Medical Informatics (WAMI). This association, however, did not received sufficient support, and was liquidated. Because data protection needed and received substantial attention in the development of the HIS, the Dutch Association for Biomedical Information Processing (VMBI) invited me to participate in IFIP WG4.4 (Data Protection in health Information Systems). I was happy to meet and work with colleagues in this group, under the leadership of Prof Gerd Griesser from Kiel university. The work resulted in a book entitled Dataprotection in Health Information Systems: Considerations and Guidelines. When IFIP TC4 was transformed into IMIA the working group continued as IMIA WG4. This working group organised several working conferences and published the  proceedings of these conferences. I have participated in this working group with pleasure and enthusiasm. For several years I served as chairman of this group. Another unique opportunity to meet international colleagues was the HIS working conference in Cape Town, South Africa, in 1979. After that successful conference it was proposed to initiate a working group for hospital information systems. Unfortunately, the proposal was not accepted. It was tried again in 1985 with success: IMIA WG 10 on Hospital Information Systems was born. This working group did organise several working conferences at: Nijmegen NL 1988; Gottingen DE 1991; Durham USA 1994; Heidelberg DE 2002; Oeiras PT 2006, Le Franshoek SA 2010. In addition to this the working group organised workshops and special sessions during many international conferences. For many years I had the pleasure to chair this working group. The Leyden HIS kept growing, the organisation behind this system was transformed into a company with some 40 hospitals (together about 50% of all hospital beds in The Netherlands) as customers. It was felt that international expansion was necessary. The company HISCOM had hospitals as main shareholders. It was felt that a strong ICT vendor with international experience was needed. We found the Baan Company with a strong market position in ERP software. They had no competing product and were willing to continue development of the HIS in The Netherlands and to market the HIS internationally. In 2000 the hospitals unanimously agreed to sell their shares to Baan Company. It was clear to me that the management style of Baan was different from mine, so I decided to leave. I founded my own little consulting company with an emphasis on the relation between ICT systems and the organisational structures of health care institutions. In addition to this, I became heavily involved in the development and roll- out of telemedicine applications \u2013 which I continue today. I\u2019ve served on the IMIA board as treasurer and as vice-president for Special Affairs, and have appreciated the contacts with international colleagues who have taught me a lot. Free University of Amsterdam ", "Barry Barber (1933 \u2013 2019)": " I studied mathematics and physics at Christ\u2019s College Cambridge, taking the theoretical option and graduating in 1954. I joined The London Hospital (now Royal) as a member of the Medical Physics Department. The head of the department was the distinguished radiation physicist, Dr Lloyd Kemp, who had developed, among other things, a precision capacitance bridge for comparing small ionization -16 currents (circa 10 amp) and the first automatic isodose plotter for radiation beams. He had proved that the National Physical Laboratory implementation B. Barber, PhD of the R\u00f6ntgen (the unit of x-ray exposure then in use) was in error by several percent. Needing to get my practical calculations accurate, I purchased an expensive slide rule with a folded scale and learned my trade as a radiation physicist measuring the outputs of x-ray sets, calculating dosage arrangements for various radiation treatments and trying to improve the accuracy of our activities. I helped Dr Kemp with some analytical analysis of his newly developed \u201cGuarded Field Ionization Chambers\u201d and eventually was awarded a doctorate. During this period, we purchased an electromechanical, Archimedes-Diehl Calculator with an 18-digit multiplier register and 24-digit accumulator register but, best of all, it had one storage register into which the results of calculations could be added! Opportunities for Operational Research and Computing. As a mathematician I was impressed with the Operational Research work done during the war and thought that such techniques could help improve the functioning of the hospital. Queuing Theory was an obvious starting point as the hospital had a very large number of Out-Patient clinics with a large east-end of London catchment area. Work had been undertaken in this area a decade before by the Nuffield Provincial Hospitals Trust, and it soon appeared that nothing much had changed since then. Many issues could be tackled traditionally, but one soon ran into problems of data capture and analysis that needed a computer to cope with the volume or complexity of the calculations. However, there were many issues about the flows of patients through the hospital\u2019s wards and departments which might be explored if clinical colleagues could be persuaded to spare the time and if relevant information could be collected. I soon discovered that it was usually easier to persuade colleagues that a computer might help them rather than that some mathematical analysis might improve their management of patient care! William (Bud) Abbott wanted to improve the hospital\u2019s finance systems. They were using punched cards equipment efficiently with multiple passes per card. The equipment was in need of replacement and could not carry out any analyses and activities. Bud Abbott had already outlined the basic systems design required to implement the finance on a computer while hospitalised for an acute illness. We received an Elliott 803 in 1964 and, although we did not know it at the time, it changed the rest of our lives. It had an 8k store of 39 bit words with a 256\u00b5sec cycle time, a floating point arithmetic unit and we had 3 magnetic film handlers as the backing  store with a reel of film capable of holding 1/4m 12 digit numbers. Bud Abbott was appointed the Computer Manager, having the existing punched card staff available to punch and verify data and become computer operators. While still working in Physics, I was encouraged to use my research time assisting with scientific and medical surveys. We had the machine and a lot to learn. I remember carrying out extensive calculations on queues with Erlang distributions of arrival times and Erlang distributions of consultation times. When I offered a paper to the Royal Statistical Society it turned out that they had had a similar paper submitted a few months earlier, but I was able to get mine published in the Operational Research Quarterly\u2014fortunately, where the published tables overlapped, they listed the same results. Another long running saga was the Obstetric Survey. The system was designed to hold all the key information relating to births in the Obstetric Department and then to provide the information for the annual report\u2014\u201cat the touch of a button\u201d. It taught me a lot about obstetric problems, but the clinicians did not like filling in the forms and all the \u201cinteresting\u201d cases somehow escaped the net. This meant that the computer files were, sadly, neither complete nor statistically representative. The scientific and medical work was run on a \u201cDo it Yourself\u201d basis after the finance systems had been run\u2014with the exception of kidney matching. During the first exploratory year, finance systems used 22% of the available time, allowing ample time for other work. Patient statistics and surveys each took 10%, operational research and physics each took 4%, the computer unit itself needed 13%. Much of the rest of the time was used by the medical college and Medical Research Council. So, the computer was well-used even during its first year. The average running time was 51 hours, increasing to 74 and 105 hours in the following years. The underlying pattern of use built up, with the finance systems taking 29%, the by now \u201cPatient Administration Systems\u201d taking 32% of the available time. An independent Operational Research Unit used 7% but we were heavily involved in many of the activities of the hospital such as a study of the emergency anaesthetic services, and the admissions and discharge study. Access to the computer was not difficult\u2014although possibly at inconvenient times. The real limitation was the hospital\u2019s lack of programmers for those not able to do it themselves. We learned a lot and gave talks on \u201cA small computer in a large hospital\u201d to other hospitals, NHS groups and we helped found the British Computer Society\u2019s Medical Specialist Group. An independent Patient Administration System for the Hospital was developed. Although others were concerned to \u201cComputerise the Medical Record\u201d, our experience suggested that it would be wise to start with the basic organisational arrangements for patient care rather than with an attempt to computerise the complex medical records directly. We believed that inappropriate patient care arising from computer errors could lead to disabilities or deaths that might bring the whole project to an end. A batch processing proposal was developed in some detail and was submitted to the Department of Health at a time when it was looking to explore opportunities for \u201cReal Time\u201d computing in the NHS. This work was reviewed in the context of real time input and output. This involved exploring the uses of real time systems in other industries and countries. The international contacts became accessible within the British Computer Society and IFIP/TC4 and IMIA. The key to the success of the system was the five-person Computer Executive controlling the project. It included the Professor of Medicine, Robert Cohen, a senior Assistant Matron, Maureen Scholes, the Deputy House Governor, Michael Fairey, the Director of Computing, Bud Abbott, and myself as Director of Operational Research. Between us, we had over 100 years of experience at the hospital and a good experience of managing change in that environment with a variety of successful projects behind us.  Prof. Cohen had a Medical Committee to which he could refer specific issues, but the clear requirement was that any systems would be developed in conjunction with and for those who would be using the systems. Frequently, the systems analysis phase uncovered surprising issues that had not been previously known or appreciated\u2014for instance, who was legally entitled to order what tests or medication. The Computer Executive endorsed the approach via the Patient Administration System rather than attempting to tackle the Medical Records directly. It also decided that each system should address a few specific issues \u201chospital-wide\u201d. The alternative \u201cpilot\u201d approach of tackling multiple activities in a single ward or department might not be scalable up for the whole the hospital later. The work would proceed in an agreed modular fashion as new areas were analysed and available for implementation\u2014there were to be no sudden design tweaks and changes of direction to accommodate the latest new idea! As the design developed, the members of the Computer Executive ran a series of one-day training sessions in the Alexandra School of Nursing for consultants, senior nurses and departmental heads. These sessions migrated from more general issues to the specifics of particular activities that were due for implementation. Great efforts were made to ensure that the menu selection processes of data entry were not longer than the previous manual system\u2014but the level of security of the information recorded should not be less than the manual system either. These twin issues could determine the success or failure of the project. Also, the Executive was clear that we would only publish papers on work that had actually been carried out instead of ideas for work that might be carried out sometime in the future. Much of the success of the system installed at The London Hospital was due to the expertise of Bud Abbott and his mastery of the technology as well as his ability to lead and inspire both his computer staff and the members of the Computer Executive. As the Director of Operational Research, I had a more free-ranging scientific brief to carry out supportive investigations of issues and approaches that might be needed as the systems developed\u2014I became a trouble shooter, operations analyst & systems evaluator. The Executive was responsible for delivering the Feasibility Study, the Invitation to Tender and for evaluating the tender. At an early stage in the development of the plans for the Real Time Patient Administration System the hospital chairman, Sir Harry Moore, passed us a paper entitled \u201cWhat Went Wrong? An Analysis of Mistakes in Data Processing Management\u201d indicating that, although no-one could guarantee success in a new field of technology, he would not expect us to fail as result of any issues high-lighted in the paper. We noted that many subsequent computer project failures have arisen as a result of failings identified at this very early stage in the implementation of computer systems. We were able and encouraged to share our experiences with other hospitals and our various professional bodies initially the Hospital Physicists Association, the Operational Research Society, the Institute of Health Services Management and the British Computer Society. In the latter case we participated in the formation of the BCS Medical Specialist Group, which later spawned a series of other groups based on geography or specialisation\u2014including the Nursing Specialist Group. In this context we received an invitation from Prof. Fran\u00e7ois Gr\u00e9my to participate in a committee on medical informatics. Thus, we became founder members of a working group of the International Federation for Information Processing, IFIP/TC4, being represented by Malcolm Forsythe, Mike Abrams, and then Bud Abbott. In MEDINFO\u201974 we had 4 papers accepted on staff training, systems development strategies & evaluation and radiation treatment planning. There after the triennial MEDINFO conferences were an integral part of our lives. Prof John Anderson, who had long participated in the Journ\u00e9es  Francophones d\u2019Informatique M\u00e9dicale held in Toulouse, and Malcolm Forsythe edited the proceedings of MEDINFO-74. Abbott subsequently became part of the IMIA Board and a new Regional Health Authority which provided extra scope for both our computing, operational research and our international activities. Since IMIA and the MEDINFO conferences were world-wide, it became clear that we should develop a European focus for medical informatics. The Copenhagen Office of WHO hosted a two-day meeting in 1976 at which it was decided that a European body should be developed\u2014and so the European Federation for Medical Informatics was established. Antoine Remond was the president of the \u201cPreliminary Council\u201d, and because they thought that I could write English, I was appointed the secretary and Peter Reichertz was the treasurer. These arrangements were built on a \u201cshoestring\u201d as there was no money. It was decided that the membership of the Federation should be the appropriate bodies representing medical computing in any country rather than individuals and that the membership fee would be set very low to encourage participation. This hid the real cost of membership because that would always involve the cost of sending representatives to participate in the EFMI meetings. The meeting established many of the basic arrangements of EFMI, including that our conferences should take place between MEDINFO conferences to avoid competition. After a second meeting EFMI was fully established with Peter Reichertz as President, as Antoine was not available, and I was the secretary. Antonio Fernandez Perez de Talens became the treasurer. For some reason, he never seemed to have a cheque book, so we accumulated money in the account and funds made in the various conferences had to be handed from one conference organiser to the next! I was able to offer to host the first EFMI conference at Churchill College Cambridge in 1978, and this turned out to be a great success making a profit that was shared between EFMI & BCS. EFMI established a rotating succession for its officers and I progressed to Vice president, President, Past President\u2014 also making me a IMIA Vice President for Europe. Although the issues of confidentiality were vital to The London Hospital computer system, I was happy to leave these issues to others, but the UK Data Protection Act of 1984 led to my developing plans and training materials for the NHS. Inevitably, I then became involved with IMIA WG4. Two working conferences outlined the approaches to these issues. Maureen Scholes and David Kenny had been previously involved. With the help of Prof. Ab Bakker, I was able to organise the next working conference at Heemskerk (1993) in The Netherlands. The results of all these working conferences were published by North Holland in the same series as other IMIA activities. This conference was followed by conferences in Helsinki (1995), Kobe (1997), Victoria (2000), Varenna (2003), Dijon (2006). All this material helped to explore issues Data Protection, Security and Safety. This latter became more evident as an issue following the publication of Ivars Peterson\u2019s \u201cFatal Defects: Chasing the Killer Computer Bugs\u201d in 1996, which raised issues of safety in critical computer systems. Also, an American study specifically addressed the fundamental issues of delivering safe health care in the complex setting of modern medicine with all its supporting systems. These issues were taken up by WG4 and its successor SIG as well as by the CEN TC251 standards group. ", "Riccardo Bellazzi": "Professor University of Pavia, Italy Chair, IMIA Working Group on Intelligent Data Analysis and Data Mining As a 4th year student in Electrical Engineering at the University of Pavia, I became quite disappointed. I found that I was not that interested in designing devices and in electronics, and I also noticed that telecommunications did not excite me either. I was mildly attracted by systems theory, which was abstract enough to be very general, applicable to many fields, and conceptually elegant. I also saw that this theory had potential applications to the medical field, an area that I always found intriguing, probably because my two older brothers were physicians and I needed to find a field where my capabilities could compete with theirs. Luckily, at that time the professor teaching Automatic Control theory (a branch of systems theory) was Mario Stefanelli. He had recently started a lab with a focus on medical informatics and artificial intelligence. I had some doubts about computer science, arising from experiences in my first computer programming course: spending many hours programming Fortran and Pascal to approximate \u03c0, or to sort arrays. I had found those classes very boring. During the same year, I also took a course in basic statistics that was given by Carlo Berzuini, one of Mario\u2019s collaborators. After that course I thought that supporting decisions with statistical methods was interesting, in particular if this could also take into account the temporal dimension, so well described by systems theory. I asked Carlo if he had a topic for my Master thesis, and I was assigned a work on Markov models and probabilistic expert systems. This in turn provided the opportunity for me to join Mario\u2019s lab: the Laboratory of Medical Informatics of the University of Pavia. The whole lab was working on a unique coherent project: building an expert system to support medical decisions based on a general epistemological model, called Select and Test (ST-model) (Ramoni et al., 1992). The ST model had been already conceptualized and implemented for supporting diagnostic reasoning in the anemias (Lanzola et al., 1990), and the lab was working on extending the model and its implementation to deal with therapy planning and monitoring, areas where time and uncertainty played a crucial role. Under the guidance of Carlo and Silvana Quaglini, a researcher and engineer expert in statistics and in informatics, I started to first implement in LISP a temporal extension of Bayesian networks based on Markov models, and then a general system to run Bayesian Networks and influence diagrams, called GAMEES (Bellazzi et al., 1991). This was part of a larger system able to run the entire ST model on a LISP machine. After my graduation and while I was still spending one year in the army during the (mandatory at that time) Italian \u201cmilitary service\u201d, I had the opportunity to apply for the PhD program in Bioengineering, which was part of a consortium of Universities led by the Politecnico of Milan. Mario and Carlo provided me the opportunity to continue my work dealing with the problem of disease monitoring in medical expert systems. During these PhD investigations, I had the idea of merging dynamic modeling and systems theory with probabilistic expert systems, and I started to work on the problem of monitoring the effect of erythropoietin (EPO) in  dialysis patients. This work was carried out together with my older brother Roberto, a nephrologist, who posed the problem of optimizing EPO treatments to deal with the severe anemia experienced by many patients with renal impairment. It was a \u201cperfect\u201d disease to test my ideas, since a non-linear dynamic model was needed to describe the patient\u2019s treatment response; the data collected on the patients were not enough to identify model parameters and to take decisions; and the patients\u2019 variability was quite high. Under the supervision of Carlo, and by applying a method proposed by him to estimate the parameters with Markov Chain Monte Carlo on a Bayesian hierarchical model (Berzuini et al., 1992), I implemented a Bayesian Network strategy for drug delivery optimization that received a SCAMC (now AMIA) Award at the student paper competition (Bellazzi, 1993). During those years, probabilistic expert systems made real advances, deeply influencing my research. On the one hand, the methodological contributions of Judea Pearl (1998), Stephen Lauritzen and David Spiegelhalter (1988), Greg Cooper and Edward Herskovits (1992) provided the formal methodologies to effectively implement such systems, on the other hand the DIAS expert system for Diabetes management designed and implemented by Ole Heilesen, Steen Andreassen and colleagues (1997) made clear to me and to the scientific community that such tools were amenable for representing dynamical systems in biomedicine. Moreover, Mario\u2019s lab used as models two labs in the USA, Mark Musen\u2019s at Stanford and Pete Szolovits\u2019s at MIT. I personally had the opportunity to visit Pete\u2019s lab. This was a short stay, but one that proved most inspiring for following-up my research. Also during my PhD and post-doc years, I had the chance to work on two EU projects led by Mario: Games and Games-II. Those projects were truly learning experiences that were most useful for all phases of my career. I learned how EU projects work, and how challenging and stimulating is to coordinate the research among different groups across Europe. Building decision support systems in a time-varying context was the goal of my research activity during the following years. In particular, a decisive event occurred in 1994, when the AAAI Spring Symposium on AI in medicine was organized by Isaac Kohane and Serdar Uckun on the topic of \u201cInterpreting clinical data\u201d (Woods et al., 1994). Two data sets were made available to challenge participants: an ICU data set and a long-term monitoring data set on type 1 Diabetes. I decided to work with the Diabetes data because they were closer to the dialysis data I had analyzed for my PhD thesis. That decision shaped my research for the following ten years, or, most truly, for the rest of my scientific career. With the publication of the DCCT trials results, there was an increasing interest in Diabetes monitoring, and coupling telemedicine systems with advanced data analytics seemed an important opportunity. My work on the AAAI Diabetes data set stimulated my lab to participate in EU calls: we proposed the implementation of decision support systems for Diabetes in a telemedicine framework. The results were two EU projects, T-IDDM and M2DM, which generated a large number of outputs and provided insightful experiences, giving me the chance to broaden the scope of my research, moving to a more ambitious goal: building complex, AI-based, IT architectures to support all aspects of chronic care management (Bellazzi et al., 2002; Larizza et al., 2006). My activities became part of the Diabetes Technology Society (DTS) promoted by David Klonoff. DTS deals with all aspects related to the implementation of innovation in Diabetes, including telemedicine and medical informatics. What came later was a further broadening of the datasets and types of tools I worked with, and the studying of the methodologies required to deal with such an increasing  amount of data. Merging data and knowledge seemed the way to go. Blaz Zupan and I proposed to IMIA to start a working group on Intelligent Data Analysis and Data Mining, which organized workshops and conferences for more than ten years (Bellazzi, Zupan, 2008). And which evolved into the IMIA working group on Data Mining and Big Data analytics. The challenges arising from molecular data stimulated my research towards the integration of molecular and clinical data, first by reapplying some of the methods I developed in the first part of my research activity, and then by widening my interests towards the effective implementation of IT systems to support the entire research process. This was possible thanks to the collaborations with Marco Ramoni, a good friend of mine, who passed away in 2010, as he was becoming a rising star at Harvard in bioinformatics, and with Zak Kohane, who is the Chair of the Biomedical Informatics Department at Harvard (Ferrazzi et al., 2012). The i2b2 framework, designed and developed at Harvard and Partners, became, at the end of the first decade of the 2000s\u2019, an important influence on the research agenda of my group. Thanks to the collaboration with the i2b2 group, a number of new initiatives started, including a laboratory at the \u201cMaugeri\u201d Hospital in Pavia, a spin-off company, and many collaborations with hospital institutions in Italy (Bellazzi et al., 2012; Murphy et al., 2017). Closing the loop, in the last years I have worked on an EU project that exploited the i2b2 infrastructure to manage and run analytics on a large cohort of type 2 Diabetes patients, merging almost all aspects of my previous research work (Dagliati et al., 2016). Looking back over the years, I can see what has been achieved and what goals and needs still remain largely unmet. Medical informatics has finally become a crucial part of the assets of the health care sector, and, at all levels, it is not anymore a matter of discussion of whether IT and decision support are decisive instruments for balancing the increase of demand and costs in health care, not only in western countries, but also worldwide. IoT and wearable devices are providing new data sources and more insights into how important the dimensions of home care are to human well-being, and molecular data are unveiling aspects that reveal how complex and diverse diseases are, explaining in some cases the observed patient variability in responses to treatments. Our IT systems are immensely more powerful than thirty years ago, and our capabilities for managing and analyzing data has grown at an unprecedented rate. Machine learning and pattern recognition are nowadays among the most interesting and finally widely recognized research fields. However, some goals have not been achieved. First of all, in Italy biomedical informatics is still not an academic field. Biomedical informaticians and bioinformaticians are dispersed over many different disciplines, including computer science, bioengineering, physics, medicine, business and management, and public health. Only recently has a Society for Biomedical Informatics (SIBIM) been restarted, after the dissolution of the earlier Italian Medical Informatics Association (AIIM). This was partly the result of the perspective still prevalent among many in Italy, that medical informatics dues not constitute a scientific field in itself, but rather involves simply the use or application of IT tools in clinical contexts. Hospitals frequently buy information systems from companies without a deep analysis of requirements and a corresponding design to meet them, and without really understanding either the technological, scientific or healthcare implications of their decisions. The Italian community in medical informatics has been quite weak, probably because we were more interested in making contributions recognized internationally, rather than nationally. In the long run, this clearly has been a limiting factor that has hampered  vigorous, creative and productive interdisciplinary growth of the field no just in Italy, but elsewhere. At the EU level, the lack of medical informatics (or biomedical informatics) as a keyword in the research categories of the European Research Council has worsened the situation, leaving our field unlabeled and unrecognized\u2014in a no-man\u2019s land. From a scientific point of view, although I\u2019m certainly glad that machine learning has become a building block of modern industry (including some aspects of health care) I have the impression that much of the great work carried on in the area of knowledge representation and expert systems has been frequently forgotten or neglected. Managing complexity and dealing with the volume, variety and variability of modern big data, not only requires high performance computing capability, but also appropriate high level abstractions to understand the basic reasoning steps underlying a clinical decision, and, in a synthetic way, to truly support (and not replace) humans in their decisions. Explanation, critiquing, case-based reasoning are words that need to be re-emphasized and deepened in their usage and impact in our modern times. As a last note, I sincerely think that I was a lucky person, because I had the chance to work with so many excellent researchers in Italy and abroad. I remember every single moment of my past in medical informatics, good or bad, as an enriching experience, full of passion and genuine belief in science. This has always made clear to me that we, as researchers, can provide real benefits to people with our intellectual capabilities. I really hope that in the latter part of my career I will be able to share and transmit to all my collaborators the same energy and knowledge that my mentors shared with me as their gift. University of Pavia ", "Bernd Blobel": "Professor of Medical Informatics University of Regensburg, Medical Faculty Founder & Chair, German National eHealth Competence Center st Visiting Professor, 1 Medical Faculty Charles University, Prague I discovered an affinity for computers in 1960, when the young mathematician Dr. Franz Stuchlik, technically supported by my father, started the Magdeburg Institute of Technology (later University of Magdeburg) Data Processing Center with the tube-based Zeiss Rechenautomat 1 computer. As member of the local Club of Young Mathematicians, I began to earnestly use this technology in 1961. Then, in 1964 B. Blobel, FACMI, FACHI, FHL7, FEFMI, FIAHSI I joined the University of Magdeburg as one of the 19 best young talents in mathematics from the Northern region of of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), selected for the first Special Class of Mathematics. I have worked with computers ever since, moving from analog to digital, and programming at all levels from machine language through Fortran to C++, Prolog, and many others besides. Universities in the GDR had to develop their own systems and software, so over the years I became proficient in establishing, maintaining, and running data processing centers as well as coding and developing software for research. My life in the GDR was defined by persistent political constraints which barred a career in any of the fields I have engaged in, beginning with excluding me from high school (gymnasium). So I first started training as a machinist. Instead of mourning these constraints, I pursued new domains of study at the universities of Magdeburg, Halle, Berlin, Leipzig, and Dresden, resulting in a multi-disciplinary portfolio: mathematics, physics, electrical engineering and cybernetics, theoretical medicine, informatics, biometry and medical informatics, and educational theory. My PhD studies in Bio- Cybernetics dealt with black-box and white-box analysis of neural receptor cells, supported by experimental measurements from animal models and laboratory systems, combining mathematical modelling, molecular biology, theoretical and biophysics, biochemistry, and medicine (especially physiology). My thesis was entitled \u201cThe mechanism of information processing and energy transformation in bio-receptors \u2013 a general and membrane structure related transducer model\u201d (in German). This model predicted a modality-independent generic mechanism controlled by the perceived input energy. My professional life begun at the Institute of Hygiene and Environmental Medicine of the Magdeburg Medical University with a project on \u201cMedical aspects of environmental protection\u201d, for which I established a laboratory to investigate physiological, psychological, and social effects of environmental factors. In the mid- 1970\u2019s, I was involved in sleep research, investigating pain mechanisms and the effects of noise and room climate, but also electromagnetic fields, on vital signs and the performance of scholars both in the laboratory and through field research. Beside developing methods, algorithms, and tools, we had to build most of our equipment, including the first East German plethysmograph (electro-mechanical and opto-electronic versions), digital voltmeters, and signal analysis for assessing environmental effects,  resulting in the definition of heart frequency variations or the relation of heart frequency to respiration frequency when measuring stress. My habilitation treatise was on \u201cObjectifying environmental effects on health\u201d. It was blocked for political reasons in the GDR and acknowledged only later as result of my rehabilitation in 1992 in the re- united Germany. Strongly supported by Dr. Burkhardt Frommelt, Research Director of the Magdeburg Medical University and former research fellow, I was appointed, against political pressure, as CIO of that institution without any formal requirements. We established a platform for remote data processing at the University of Magdeburg\u2019s Data Processing Center using private lines and supported research and development work with algorithms and the performance of statistical investigations. With the advent of medium-sized computers, and then micro-computers, in 1980 I left the field of environmental medicine, and, with the extension of my CIO position, was appointed chair of a new Medical Data Processing Group\u2014which later evolved into the Medical Informatics Group\u2014at the Research Directorate of the Medical University, which included all facilities throughout the Medical University. This group was later combined with the Department of Biometry, Bernd Blobel with Jana Zv\u00e1rov\u00e1 forming the Institute of Biometry and Medical Informatics at the Medical University of Magdeburg. I also became involved in teaching and the further education of students and staff for the organization as well as for the entire region of Saxony-Anhalt. Because finance, administration, and management were highly centralized, the Medical Informatics Group and Department mainly focused on supporting the clinical staff, and on the automation of processes, as well as the support of research, development, and education. We developed adaptive algorithms for improving immune-assay analyses in laboratory diagnostics, advances in heart diagnostics (electrocardiographic body surface mapping), a registry for newborn genetics, process automation for scientific libraries and pharmacies, as well as departmental systems. Because of the multi- disciplinary education involved, our solutions were quite advanced and included software such as a statistics package for personal computers, and a graphics interface system for home computers (preceding Microsoft\u2019s Power Point). Because of the lack of alternatives within the GDR, our solutions were deployed throughout the country. We adapted and implemented solutions developed by other universities, and we supported students and graduates in data analysis and statistics both for mainframes as well as PCs. Due to the political climate, it was difficult or impossible to communicate with international scientists and institutions (e.g. participating in international conferences even when organized in the GDR), or to be appointed to a professorship despite my  qualifications. Instead, I had to get my work presented by others (e.g. my privileged co- workers), and my research remained unpublished or only partially published by my students. The bridge to the international community was limited to materials publicly available in GDR scientific libraries. So, during the first 20 years of my professional life, this resulted in only 9 local publications, compared with about 500 that I produced over the following 20 years. With the vigorous support of Rolf Engelbrecht, the first international conference I was able to attend was MIE 1996 in Copenhagen, after having been involved in a Security Workshop at MEDINFO 1995 in Vancouver. German reunification changed my personal and professional life dramatically. I could exchange emails throughout the country and beyond, and could travel and engage with colleagues without any limitations. The early OMG (Object Management Group) work became my focus since object-oriented approaches had been employed in our system designs. In 1990 and 1991, the Medical University of Magdeburg staff were subject to an external evaluation, resulting in my being fully rehabilitated scientifically and politically, so that in 1993 I was appointed as Professor of Medical Informatics. However, this was revoked when the new Dean from Western Germany enforced a rule that no former East German scientist could be appointed. The early 1990\u2019s saw new organizational and administrative frameworks, and the replacement of hardware and software by new commercially produced and licensed products and solutions. One project in cooperation with our neighboring state of Lower Saxony was a regional cancer center, including a cross-organizational cancer registry following the Hannover example. We were required to develop security and privacy solutions, so I dove into IT security and privacy issues for health, adding measures for hardware encryption to establish the first secure and trustworthy health network in Germany. This achievement led to my engagement as Chair/Vice-Chair of the security groups of the German Health Informatics Association (GMDS), the European Federation of Medical Informatics (EFMI), the Medical Informatics Association (IMIA), but also the German Society for Privacy and Security (GDD). It was also the motivation for including us in most of the EU projects on security and privacy. To replace our hospital information system with a commercial one, we looked for an advanced system environment such as UNIX, and visited companies and institutions in the former-FRG including the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), the University Library in G\u00f6ttingen, and the University of Giessen. Joachim Dudeck from Giessen, who had grown up in the GDR, was especially able to appreciate our situation and to understand our constraints. With Joachim Dudeck, my department became well-known for implementing regional clinical cancer registries and a related federal cancer registry. He integrated our university into the Hessian Universities\u2019 WING (Wissensbasiertes Informations-Netz im Gesundheitswesen \u2013 Knowledge Based Information Network in Healthcare) project with an advanced approach to hospital information systems (HIS), enhancing availability and fault tolerance through Tandem Computer technology, and bringing our educational program to the cutting-edge. Unfortunately, the corresponding international research could not be transformed into a commercial product. So, we decided together with Siegfried P\u00f6ppl from the University of L\u00fcbeck to go for the newest and first UNIX-based HIS product in Germany\u2014the Medico system of Data Plan, a small and very innovative company. We contributed with our colleagues from the North to the further evolution of the Data Plan system, advancing its functionality, but also deploying the intelligence of the INGRES database and its stored procedures, as well as its recovery mechanisms. Later on, Data Plan was sold to Smart Medical Systems (SMS) in the USA and was later  bought by Siemens Medical Solutions. Joachim Dudeck and I improved health information systems interoperability and launched HL7 Germany in 1993. He introduced me to the international health informatics standardization community at HL7, ISO, CEN, including the national mirror groups. In consequence, I chaired HL7 Germany from 1994-2013, became the first non-US co-chair of an HL7 Working Group (the Security WG) in 1997, and held this position until 2014. I was Security WG chair for OMG, authoring ISO, CEN, HL7, OMG, and ASTM specifications from multiple perspectives, bringing the latest research and development results into practice through standards. The first Western visitor to my department was Rolf Engelbrecht, who encouraged me to establish and chair a Medical Informatics Professionals Association for Saxony- Anhalt, which later was integrated into the Federal Medical Informatics Professionals Association that Rolf led at that time. Thanks to Joachim Dudeck and Rolf Engelbrecht, we worked on a series of EU projects such as HANSA (Healthcare Advanced Networked Systems Architecture), DIABCARD (Improved Communication in Diabetes Care Based on Chip Cards), ISHTAR (Implementing Secure Healthcare Telematics Applications in Europe), TrustHealth1 and 2 (Trustworthy Health Telematics), EUROMED-ETS (Trusted Third Party Services for Healthcare in Europe), MEDSEC (Health Care Security and Privacy in the Information Society), SENSATION (Advanced Sensor Development for Attention, Stress, Vigilance & Sleep/Wakefulness Monitoring), HARP (Harmonization for the Security of Web Technologies and Applications), RESHEN (Regional Secure Healthcare Networks), EHCR-SupA (Electronic Healthcare Record Communications \u2013 Supporting Action), BioHealth (Security and Identity Management Standards in eHealth including Biometrics- Specific Requirements having an Impact on the European Society and on Standardization), Q-REC (European Quality Labelling and Certification of Electronic Health Record systems (EHRs)), COST Action IC 0604 \u2013 EURO TELEPATH (Anatomic Telepathology Network). In the mid-1990\u2019s, I was appointed to teach Medical Informatics for Computer Visualisation. After successfully completing the habilitation process, I joined the Medical Faculty while remaining a member of the Informatics Faculty. The engagement in EC initiatives and standardization effort on EHR systems such as the GEHR project and CEN 13606, the active work in the HL7 Medical Records WG, but also the successful work in the EU Q-Rec project and the implementation of the German ProRec Center, led to my becoming Founding Chair of the EFMI EHR WG. Through these international projects and standardization efforts, I got involved in many new EU projects and activities in Brussels: as chair of the eHealth Standardization Focus Group, as Health Telematics Advisor of the Federal Minister of Health and the German health telematics platform project \u201cBetter IT for better health\u201d (Bit4health). That time, the European Commission decided to implement eHealth Competence Centers (eHCCs) in all EU Member States. Before moving to the University of Regensburg in Bavaria, I launched and chaired the Health Telematics Group at the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits (IIS) in Erlangen. Approved by the organizations establishing the \u201cSelf-management structure of the German health system\u201d and by the Federal Ministry of Health, and supported by Michael Nerlich, president of the International Association for Telemedicine and eHealth, in 2006 I was appointed to chair the German eHCC. Besides engaging in national projects such as the specification of the German EHR and EHR system, I became an international expert for advising on national health telematics, eHealth, EHR, and security and privacy  projects in countries including the USA, UK, Syria, Canada, Finland, Norway, Ireland, Malaysia, Colombia, and Peru. An International Interdisciplinary PhD and Postdoc College with the eHCC, enabled students from all over the world to carry out their studies. The College closely collaborated with Jana Zvarova\u2019s EuroMISE Institute in Prague. Through the international EuroMISE Mentor Association, in 2017 this led to a Visiting Professorship at the First Medical Faculty of Charles University in Prague. In summary, more than 70 PhD students from many countries around the world have been supervised/co-supervised during my professional life. To conclude, I thank and appreciate the support of my many friends in IMIA, and especially to my closest colleagues Peter Pharow, Diego Lopez, Frank Oemig, and Kjeld Engel. L. to R.: B. Richards, J. Zvarova, M. Ball, R. Haux, J. van Bemmel at EuroMISE 2013 ", "Anita Burgun": "Professor and Head, Department of Biomedical Informatics at Paris Descartes University I owe my entry into the field of medical informatics to literature. I was an avid reader of SF novels where robots closely interact with humans, where the nature of virtual reality is questioned, and the philosophical themes of human identity and essence are explored. I was fascinated by what is called \u00abartificial intelligence \u00bb, the ability of computers to mimic human intelligence, the powers of logical reasoning, the capacity of abstraction, the ability to discover links between events, the possibility of robots to collaborate with humans. It looked like understanding the mechanisms of human intelligence and being able to implement them into machines. After high school, I was not sure what I should study at university and I hesitated a lot between medicine and computer science. I opted for a medical curriculum. However, as I was studying medicine, I was also looking for computer science programs and I applied for a newly-established educational program in medical informatics at Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris. This program was created by Fran\u00e7ois Gr\u00e9my, a visionary faculty member who was able to understand the stakes of informatics in the health sector very early I was accepted to this program and this is how I first met Pierre Le Beux and Patrice Degoulet, that I now consider my mentors. Pierre was the expert systems guy, and Patrice was the data base specialist. I quickly became convinced that artificial intelligence should be further developed in the medical field. As a physician, I saw computers, databases and decision support systems as tools to provide better care to patients. It crystallized my choice of also following a computer science curriculum. It was then that I bought my first Apple computer, with which I started developing my own programs. Acquiring advanced skills in algorithms and infrastructure was a lot of fun and most stimulating - especially the course on logic programming. I finished my MD and receved a master\u2019s degree in computer science with honors. Following my graduation, I was recruited at Rennes University and Rennes hospital by Pierre Le Beux to work on electronic health record systems and clinical decision support systems. Solutions to address interoperability issues in hospital information systems and methods to design concept-based reasoning, all brought me to work on ontologies (Burgun 2006). Research on biomedical ontology was very active, with outstanding programs like the Unified Medical Language System at the US National Library of Medicine (NLM) and the OBO Foundry of open access ontologies. Our common objective was to enable inter-linkage between data sources, and to provide findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) resources for intelligent programs. I had the privilege to work as a visiting faculty at the NLM with Olivier Bodenreider and Alexa McCray, and to interact with Barry Smith on formal ontologies. Formal ontology is particularly challenging in medicine, as the medical domain includes plenty of variables, relations between concepts, and fuzzy classes. The author that influenced me the most at that time was Ludwig Wittgenstein. (I was in a bookstore and opened On Certainty. I got stuck when I read the first sentence: \u00ab If  you do know that here is one hand, we\u2019ll grant you all the rest \u00bb. No author demonstrated the complexity of knowledge better than Wittgenstein. He assumed the logical nature of knowledge (\u201cthe world is the totality of facts, the facts in logical space are the world\u201d), but still questioning it as a system (\u201cwhen one says that such and such a proposition can't be proved, of course that does not mean that it can't be derived from other propositions; any proposition can be derived from other ones. But they may be no more certain than it is itself\u201d)\u201d; he drew a limit to thought, or more exactly, to the expression of thought, highlighting the difficulty of sharing knowledge through language (see what Wittengstein called language games and private language), and the epistemic status of assumptions and their link to mental states (\u201cThat he does know remains to be shown\u201d). Research on ontology has been very stimulating. We spent a lot of time debating, creating ontologies; we made them compatible and shared them with others; we developed applications based on ontologies, not only to make applications interoperable but also to support medical decisions, for example in oncology to provide a formal classification of the grades of disease progression based on the recorded pathology features (Marquet 2007), and in clinical research to match the inclusion and exclusion criteria with the EHR data (Dameron 2013). We demonstrated that ontology-based reasoning could be used to classify atrial fibrillation alerts with results comparable to expert cardiologists (Rosier 2016). A major shortcoming of existing ontologies is however their difficulty to integrate probabilistic notions, a research question that was tackled only through extensions of classical description logics. On the other hand, machine learning offers solutions that exploit the co-occurrences of real data. Such learning techniques obtain optimal results in the presence of \u201cbig\u201d volumes of standardized data and a limited number of classes, e.g., malignant or not. The wide adoption of EHRs in hospitals and primary care offers new opportunities for developing artificial intelligence in medicine. When Patrice Degoulet asked me if I would like to join the Georges Pompidou European Hospital (HEGP) team at Paris Descartes University in 2012, I felt honored, excited, and enthusiastic about making the link between data, knowledge, and medical decision. Patrice was a pioneer in clinical information systems: he installed in 2008 the first i2b2 clinical data warehouse ever used in France. Thanks to his legacy, it was easy for me to design new projects and develop collaborations with clinicians and researchers from Paris Descartes and AP-HP HEGP (Jannot 2017) and the Necker hospitals (Garcelon 2017). Altogether, we have conducted research on methods to learn from a limited number of heterogeneous cases, with complex phenotypes and complex underlying biological mechanisms. I strongly believe in multidisciplinarity. I\u2019ve been the head of the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Paris Descartes University since 2014. When I arrived in Paris, I created a multidisciplinary group with backgrounds in mathematics, biostatistics, bioinformatics, and medical informatics. It is only at the intersection of all these subjects that new methods combining knowledge modeling, advanced reasoning systems, together with statistical and machine learning, can be created. \u00ab Thank you, Steve Jobs, for the jolt. \u00bb ", "Catherine Chronaki": "Secretary General, HL7 International Foundation Institutional Members Officer, EFMI Board (2016-2018) VP EFMI Working Groups (2018-2020) My journey in Medical Informatics started in Crete Thinking back to my school days, my career path felt like the Irish mist, full of old stories and new promises. I loved books, languages, science. All I remember is \u201cwhy\u2026\u201d and \u201cwhat if\u2026\u201d questions that came to me as I kept my eyes open in the endless blue of the Cretan sea. Pondering the connection between the past, the present and the future was my favorite pastime. Meanwhile, my father\u2019s profession led us to move frequently, with every new city presenting a new opportunity. At fifteen, a linguist\u2019s book discussing the origin and journey of the words from Homer\u2019s Iliad and Odyssey to Modern Greek, Latin, and English left a lasting impression on me. From then on, words were alive and full of magic, and traveling through time, they were shaping people\u2019s feelings and behaviors. My fascination with databases and knowledge engineering continued through my bachelor studies in Computer Engineering and Informatics at the University of Patras, Greece and my graduate studies in Rochester, NY. It was during my graduate studies, after a presentation on ICT standards, that I thought to myself: \u201cStandards can certainly help us understand what we are talking about, but could they be more boring?\u201d After receiving my Master\u2019s in Computer Science on Parallelism in Functional Programming languages and small contributions in Theoretical Computer Science working on the closest pair and Evasiveness problems, I moved to industry to get some practical experience. It was in the summer of 1990, while working as an intern in the DOM project on Active Databases at GTE labs in Waltham, Massachusetts that I heard from Frank Manola the word interoperability for the first time. \u201cWhat a complicated word!\u201d I thought to myself. Back to Crete - Medical Imaging and the DiCom standard: In 1992, I returned with my husband, Evangelos Markatos, to Crete, to work at the Institute of Computer Science, Foundation for Research and Technology (ICS-FORTH) and the University of Crete, respectively. I was fortunate to join the group of Professor Stelios Orphanoudakis, a great visionary, pioneer, leader, and mentor. I started as the technical manager of the AIM-2 EurIPACS project. My experience with databases proved useful in the design and 2 implementation of I C, a system for the Indexing and Retrieval of Medical Imaging by Content. Relevant results appeared in Medical Informatics Europe between 1994-1997. 2 The added-value of I C was demonstrated by connecting to the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) of hospitals allowing radiologists to review cases associated with diagnostic images that were visually similar. That is how we started with the DICOM3 standard and how I met Professor Manolis Tsiknakis, a young researcher, at that time, who was the lead of the PACS project and much later the successor of Prof. Orphanoudakis in the lab. My colleague Stavros Kos Anolakis, a talented programmer, was so excited to exchange emails with the DICOM guru David Clunie, seeking help in  downloading and running one of the first DICOM implementations from the United States. HYGEIAnet. In the \u201chealth telematics\u201d era of the late 1990\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s, the lab of Professor Orphanoudakis had the vision, the culture, and the funding to advance the frontiers of medical informatics. My two daughters Lilika (1994) and Marina (1997) were born in the hospital but were raised in the lab among exciting projects as HYGEIAnet turned the island of Crete into a living lab. Around 1998, my role expanded to include managing projects for HYGEIAnet in the prefecture of Heraklion, in addition to European Commission funded projects, and a software development team. Our activities spread from user requirement analysis to development and deployment, as well as training and evaluation. Getting to know the problem-oriented record of Larry Weed was influential in implementing the virtual life- long, longitudinal health record as a directory of geographically distributed medical encounters structured according to the Subjective Objective Assessment Plan (SOAP) model in the HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) standard. We created one of the first proof-of-concept implementations of the Virtual Electronic Health Record, using directory services by ISODE and IHE profiles, launching an ad-hoc architecture team that resulted in an extensive pivotal report co-authored with Dimitris Katehakis that a decade later led the group that transferred these projects into daily practice throughout Greece. Interoperability standards were essential in ensuring continuity and reuse of software components across systems and services. Step-by-step we became more engaged with HL7, and in 2003, ICS-FORTH became a founding member of HL7-Hellas. In 2006, while at the TEPHR conference in Seattle, I met Liora Alschuler, co-inventor of the HL7 CDA. In a follow-up meeting, I was interviewed about HYGEIAnet for a US National Library of Medicine report. Liora helped me understand the value of conveying the users\u2019 point of view to standards organizations. With HYGEIAnet as a living lab, there was energy and drive from seeing that technology has an impact on people\u2019s lives. Among many HYGEIAnet projects in the \u201990\u2019s, I recall fondly ET-ASSIST, EMISPHER, and Ten-Telemed. ET-ASSIST offered services to insurance companies and their local correspondents managing medical evacuation events involving tourists. EMISPHER focused on remote medical training in the Mediterranean Sea, and engaging with Turkey, Algeria, Morocco, and Egypt, we learned about the interplay of technology, culture, and health systems. TenTelemed took actions to prepare a startup in the nascent area of eHealth. Ten- Telemed is still a vibrant company, a successful example of European Commission investment on innovation led by Yoanni Matsakis. HYGEIAnet created an environment conducive to innovation. Professor Papas from the Aristoteleio University of Thessaloniki would bring his master\u2019s students to Crete every year for Medical Informatics in action. It is unfortunate that a reorganization of the healthcare system that made the primary care centers independent from the regional hospital stopped scaling- up the telecardiology service. That was a big lesson: never underestimate organizational interoperability and political dynamics. Engaging with standards organizations - openECG. Around 1998, Franco Chiarugi moved to Crete with his wife and son from the ECG Industry and joined the team along with Philip Lees. Philip had implemented a national cardiac registry and a cardiology information system, while at the Cardiology Department of the University Hospital led by Professor Panos Vardas, Past President of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). Franco connected us with Christoph Zywietz and in 2001, we started\u2014together with Morten Bruun-Rasmussen (then with MedCom), Fabrizio  Conforti and Alberto Macerata from CNR, and Ricardo Ruiz from Madrid\u2014the openECG initiative. With openECG, we got serious with standards adoption to advance interoperability, and I got even closer to standards organizations. OpenECG posed a deceptively simple question: \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice if every patient had a digital ECG in their electronic health record stored in a format independent from the device that recorded it?\u201d I am eternally grateful to Christoph Zywietz for teaching me to ask questions and challenge my own assumptions about what team members or organizations have to offer. As with all HYGEIAnet projects, the whole family was on board with openECG. It was colorful and allowed the girls to play with lots of gadgets and listen to stories. In the Q&A part of a workshop around 2004 in Charakas, Crete, my daughter Lilika (or was it Marina?) asked to hear \u201cthe story of Open Egg\u201d and everyone laughed! Was that enough for the broad adoption of the SCP-ECG standard? Not really, and the question of standards as a quality label for interoperability in the digital age keeps me going. Through Philip Lees, Franco Chiarugi, and Christoph Zywietz, we became part of the Computing in Cardiology community and the ESC working group on eCardiology. We met with George Moody and Prof. Roger Mark in MIT, and almost a decade later, I spent some wonderful creative time at the Clinical Physiology lab in Cambridge, when we followed our daughter Lilika to Boston for her engineering studies. The Physionet challenge and the MIMIC2 database were predecessors to the Hackathon and Datathon events that engage young developers and FAIR data principles for Health Research. The OpenECG project received funding for two years. The openECG community thrived for several years and SCP-ECG became an ISO standard part of the IEEE11073 family thanks to Todd Cooper, Massaki Hirai, and many others. The team, with Franco being the lead standards expert, managed to sustain the network and the openECG helpdesk for SCP-ECG for another 7 to 8 years. In the end however, openECG, like many volunteer efforts died out, after a final unsuccessful effort to hand its services over to the ESC. On the bright side, with a strong standards and interoperability mindset, our group built modular software and the team was systematic in the consistent implementation of standards. WebOnColl, a scalable standards-based medical collaboration environment embodies these principles. The \u201cWHO eHealth Consumer Survey,\u201d a project led by Tove Sorenson, head of the WHO Collaborative center in Tromso, changed our perception of the role of eHealth consumers in the adoption of interoperability and standards. This project helped me understand that the successful deployment of eHealth requires broad and deep engagement of stakeholders that do not speak the same language and that requires social science tools as much as it needs technology. Once again, I was suddenly fifteen, thinking about the meaning of words and their power\u2026in the search for Ithaca. Epidemiology, Disaster and Emergency Medicine. It was around 2007, with Satellites for Epidemiology (SAFE), a grant from the European Space agency thanks to Yoanni Matsakis, Dimitris Vourvahakis, and many others, that we made a breakthrough into Emergency and Disaster Medicine. The region of Crete organized an interagency civil protection exercise. The exercise scenario was an epidemic breakout in the aftermath of an earthquake disaster run on location at a resort hotel, a power plant, an evacuation camp, as well as local, regional, and national coordination centers. Several years later in 2018-2019, as part of the Trillium II team, I joined again the EUMODEX exercises in Bucharest and Saaremaa to test the concept of the IPS in disaster medicine. SAFE opened a new area of work, and thanks to funding from the European Commission and in close cooperation with the CYPRUS civil defence, we continued work on a  simulation exercise for earthquakes and tsunamis (POSEIDON, 2010) and pollution (NEREIDs, 2013). In POSEIDON, we worked with innovative triage protocols where we had the opportunity to work jointly with an emergency respondent\u2019s team and bring research and innovation closer to the practice of civil protection thanks to Professor Costas Synolakis and Prof. Eleni Kokkinou. Working at the intersection of environment, climate and health bringing together complementary teams and capabilities was quite challenging but raised again the issue of interoperability standards as enabler. The NEREIDs project and my move to Boston marked my transition from FORTH. In the same period, Prof. Tsiknakis was leading a large European funded project entitled \u201cACGT - Advancing Clinico-Genomic Clinical Trials on Cancer: Open Grid Services for Improving Medical Knowledge Discovery\u201d, which began a new stream of research and development work at the lab in the wider domain of biomedical informatics. Again, standardization was a key aspect of our work, leading to a cancer domain ontology termed \u201cThe ACGT Master Ontology on Cancer\u201d, now part of the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies Foundry. HL7 International Foundation and the Trillium Bridge project: While I was serving on the board of directors of HL7 International (2008-2012), Ed Hammond suggested exploring regional offices for HL7. Revisiting HL7 Europe seemed quite attractive. The European HL7 Foundation was established in 2010, and I assumed the role of secretary general. The MoU on EU/US cooperation in eHealth provided the backdrop for Trillium Bridge, a project that compared specification of patient summaries used cross-border in the EU and across health systems in the United States. There is no doubt that Trillium Bridge strengthened not only cooperation of HL7 with CEN TC/251 of Health Informatics, but also cooperation with EFMI. I joined the EFMI Council in 2002 and the EFMI board in 2016 as institutional member officer and in 2018 as vice president for Working Groups. International Patient Summaries (IPS): Several EU policy support actions built on the results of Trillium Bridge, including EXPAND (beyond epSOS), ASSESS-CT (assessment of SNOMED-CT as reference terminology), openMedicine (unique identification of medicinal products), and eStandards (standards and profiles for sustainable eHealth development). In these projects, working closely with Robert Stegwee, Petra Wilson, Giorgio Cangioli and many others) we have strengthened and broadened cooperation of standards organizations as reflected in the International Patient Summary project. The eStandards roadmap advocates that standards organizations engage with the full standards lifecycle, employing the principles of active co-creation, flexible governance, and continuous alignment and Trillium II implemented these ideas for the IPS. Now, we have high hopes for the UNICOM project to tackle the equivocal identification of medicines with consistent implementation of the IDMP standard. Looking forward. There are many opportunities to broaden and deepen cooperation between academia, and policy and standards organizations in Health Informatics as precision medicine becomes a part of life. The role of the patient summary as a window to a person\u2019s health information and a starting point to explore a patient\u2019s health data illustrates the shift towards considering standards as infrastructure for innovation. EFMI\u2019s and IMIA\u2019s institutional memory helps us remember what we tried in the past, what worked, and what did not, and that can help us avoid repeating previous mistakes. As the International Patient Summary is again back in fashion, writing this article makes me wonder what we learned from the Medical Summary of Francis Roger France and the Traveler\u2019s record of George Mihalas\u2026 ", "Philippe Cinquin": "Professor of Medical Informatics, Grenoble University Medical School (France). Head, CNRS Research Unit. Maurice E. Muller Award (Computer Orthopedic Surgery), 2013 Ambroise Par\u00e9 Award of the French Academy of Surgery, 2014 European Inventor Award (Glucose Bio-Fuel Cell), 2014 I started working in BMHI in 1977 in Dijon (France) with Liliane and Pierre Dusserre, and with Henri Bastien. At that time, I was in my second year of medical studies, and I had decided to get a double education in the sciences (Applied Mathematics) and in Medicine: this choice had led me to quit the Polytechnique, a renowned P. Cinquin, PhD, MD French school of engineers. Pierre Dusserre and Henri Bastien were anatomo-pathologists, and they had been the first ones to understand the potential value of a simplified ontology capable of describing anatomical-pathological findings and simple epidemiological data, which they named \u201cADICAP\u201d. A major added-value of ADICAP was that it had been developed collaboratively, with a consensus among the specialists about its contents. At the same time, all the anatomical-pathological laboratories in the region of Burgundy had chosen the same computer system to manage their activities, so that all the findings shared not only the same conceptual structure (based on ADICAP) but also the same type of data-base: therefore their information systems were perfectly \u201cinter-operable\u201d - except that in these pioneering days, the data were recorded on huge physical disks of \u2026 5 MB, which had to be sent physically to other locations for sharing. I am very grateful to Pierre Dusserre and Henri Bastien, who entrusted me the responsibility of developing a statistical package capable of mining the huge quantity of the records that they received on a regular basis from their network of colleagues. This is where I learnt to program computers! Liliane Dusserre, Pierre\u2019s wife, was at that time Professor of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics. She took me into her team to assist students, and to work on several medical informatics projects, while I was pursuing my medical studies. A few years later (1980), I had started a Ph D in Applied Mathematics, and I met Pierre Gramont, who was professor of Orthopedic Surgery, and wished to reduce the ratio of failures of total hip prostheses. He had the intuition that the tail of these prostheses could be tailored to the anatomy. This was a time when Computed Tomography was not yet very well developed, so I had to invent new types of \u201cspline functions\u201d, in order to define the optimal shape of the tail of femoral prostheses from a set of at least two X-ray images of the femur of the patient. This was my first experience in medical image processing for optimizing surgical procedures, which would become a few years later my research domain. After my PhD, in 1982, I went to Grenoble to work with Pierre-Jean Laurent, an expert in spline functions, who introduced me to Jacques Demongeot. Jacques was at that time assistant professor, and I am very grateful to him for having immediately taken me into his team, to help him develop medical informatics in Grenoble, in the general frame of the French initiative launched by Fran\u00e7ois Gr\u00e9my. This initiative made it possible for us to obtain not only a mini-computer (VAX 11/780), but also a workstation with an architecture devoted to image processing. This was the real kick-off of the adventure which led Jacques to create in Grenoble University Hospital first the Department of Medical Informatics, then a CNRS lab, TIMC-IMAG, and later a Centre  for Clinical Investigation \u2013 Technological Innovation. After completing my medical studies, and although I worked hard on the specifications and early development of an Integrated Hospital Information System in Grenoble, I focused on medical image analysis, with methodological approaches benefitting from my background in Applied Mathematics. Though this domain remains very interesting, I rapidly felt that image analysis could be used not only to put a diagnosis, but also to assist therapeutic procedures. It quickly became clear that to do so, image analysis should be considered as one element of a wider domain, Computer Assisted Medical Interventions (CAMI), and that the driving force for advances in biomedical research should preferably be the medical demand rather than the technical push. My education as a physician made this easier for me. This domain also required robotics and a new technique - Surgical Navigation. I therefore progressively moved from image analysis to CAMI systems design. This evolution intrinsically implies an interdisciplinary approach that starts from careful analysis of medical requirements, and may require, depending on the results of this analysis, very different types of research (new sensor development, calibration or integration, image segmentation, multi-modal image registration, biomechanical modelling, robot design, \u2026), which draw on very different domains (applied mathematics, computer science, robotics, etc). This naturally led me to set up collaborations with colleagues capable of bringing the required complementary skills. The CAMI domain is now a well-established research area. I am convinced that a major challenge in this domain is to invent a \u201cnumerical companion\u201d, capable of guaranteeing the highest surgical Quality to all patients. This numerical companion should be able to advise in real time the surgeon when the procedures he or she performs depart from \u201cgood practice guidelines\u201d. Achieving this challenge raises not only scientific and technical issues (defining what is a \u201cgood practice guideline\u201d; acquire all relevant pre- and per-operative data and estimate in real time a \u201cconceptual distance\u201d between the \u201cgood practice guideline\u201d and the actual procedure), but also human and organizational issues (set up and run a cooperative network to share into \u201cobservatories\u201d the huge number of data about the performance of surgical procedures which is mandatory in order to define the \u201cgood practice guidelines\u201d, taking into account confidentiality issues in order to respect patient\u2019s and surgeon\u2019s privacy). I am convinced that CAMI methodology, implemented today with systems that are far from being miniaturized, would also work for implanted systems. Miniaturisation has now sufficiently progressed to make it possible to design micro-systems capable of being implanted and whose design could benefit from the expertise gathered in CAMI system design. However, energy remains a major obstruction on this road. I started exploring this challenge in 2003. We have since demonstrated the feasibility of glucose biofuel cells, capable of using the glucose that is naturally present in the biological fluids of human beings. These could be used to power implanted medical devices, including the new generation of leadless pacemakers, but also devices such as robotic urinary sphincters, which are much more energy demanding. Glucose biofuel cells are perhaps the first element of a new family of \u201csymbiotic implantable robots\u201d. A glucose biofuel cell is indeed a device that depends on the host organism to provide its fuel and to eliminate the by-products. But the host organism also depends on the glucose biofuel cell, if the latter produces energy required to operate a pacemaker. We are presently exploring the possibility of designing other symbiotic robots, for instance capable of modulating the intestinal microbiota, which will imply convergence of techniques of CAMI and of implantable biological reactors. ", "Patrice Degoulet": "Emeritus Professor, Paris Descartes University IMIA Gr\u00e9my Award of Excellence, 2015 IMIA Vice-President (2001-04) Past President, VP & Gen. Sec., French Association of Medical Informatics (AIM) My personal interest in medical informatics started in very early 1971. I was just appointed as a resident physician at the Paris University Hospital (\u201cInternat des H\u00f4pitaux de Paris\u201d) and had to organize my four years of training to be licensed as a medical specialist. Nephrology was my field of choice, but I was also fascinated by the early medical informatics research at Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re where Fran\u00e7ois Gr\u00e9my had just been appointed as Professor of P. Degoulet, MD, MSc, Biostatistics and Medical Informatics (1970). I remembered PhD, FACMI, FIAHSI by first discussion with him explaining my interest in dual training in medicine and more basic sciences. He had hesitated himself and I followed the same strategy. I immediately started a master\u2019s degree in biostatistics with Prof Daniel Schwartz at Paris 11 University and an MSc Degree in biomathematics and medical informatics at Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re with Fran\u00e7ois Gr\u00e9my. Prof. Marcel Legrain, the Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re nephrologist, put me in contact with the Notre-Dame University hospital in Montreal (Canada) which was developing with one of his former students, Dr. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Marichal, an electronic medical record for patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis. I was accepted as a research fellow in Montreal for 18 months. I remember several visits I made to emerging medical informatics groups in North America that I made during this period, including Vermont (L. Weed), Mass General Hospital, and El Camino, which was starting the TDS hospital information system. This convinced me that I was following an emerging and fascinating path. When I returned in France in May 1973, Prof Legrain offered me the opportunity to work for the DIAPHANE dialysis registry that he had just started with 20 dialysis centers in France. Data were recorded from standardized and structured questionnaires. I was able to improve them at the same time that I carried out epidemiologic studies from DIAPHANE for the French society of Nephrology. I was impressed by the power of structured data to search for risk factors, build prediction models, but also grasp the impact of a comparative evaluation of the medical strategies across dialysis centers. Development of structured and standardized electronic medical records (1974- 1977). DIAPHANE questionnaires were completed after treatment and sent to the coordinating data center at Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re. This was not entirely satisfactory for me. The Montreal experience had shown me that data entry could preferably be integrated into the regular care workflow without compromising the reuse of data for clinical or epidemiological research. This gave rise to my first structured and standardized electronic record for hypertensive patients, the ARTEMIS system, developed with Professor Joel M\u00e9nard and deployed in September 1975 at the St. Joseph Hospital in Paris. My residency period was the opportunity to get training in different medical  departments and start designing standardized records for diabetes, asthma, cardiac surgery, chronic renal failure, and obstetrics. Software engineering initiatives (1983-1997). From the perspective of IT architectures, the 1980\u2019s were characterized by the spread of departmental solutions, multimedia workstations, but also artificial intelligence and natural language processing in medicine. The heads of medical units were ready to find funding for their domains of expertise to undertake research studies from dedicated electronic health records. I did not find hierarchical or relational database management systems (DBMS) well adapted to the management of temporal data which were then, and remain, a key issue in medicine. This was the driver for the development of the LIED data language (\u201cLangage Interactif pour l\u2019exploitation des donn\u00e9es\u201d). LIED, developed in close collaboration with an engineer, Dominique Sauquet, included its own temporal data description and manipulation language. The ARTEMIS system was the first one to move in 1983 from the Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re DIGITAL PDP10 central system to a DIGITAL PDP11 and then HP minicomputers with Unix. ARTEMIS/LIED had its own dictionary of concepts influenced by the LDS experience in Salt Lake City, a data entry line editor developed by Pierre Zweigenbaum, a data manipulation language to reuse data for research, and an embedded expert system shell developed by Vincent Morice. All structured records described above (e.g., diabetes, asthma, valvulopathies and coronary artery diseases) were progressively deployed on Unix-based departmental computers to be used in the mid-eighties in more than 40 medical units in France. LIED and its application description was the core of my 1984 PhD thesis. Issues of interoperability sprung up with the explosive development of departmental systems in ancillary departments such as biology, pharmacy, imaging and various medical units. Medical multimedia workstations were considered a necessity to cope with the heterogeneous nature of medical data. Other European colleagues experienced the same difficulties. This was the background of the HELIOS software engineering project and development platform with partners from Sweden (Prof O. Wigertz) for the development of interfaces, Germany (Prof. HP Meinzer) for image processing, and Switzerland (JR Scherrer) for NLP processing. A message-oriented middleware (HELIOS unification bus) was developed at Broussais as well as a concept manager and semantic mapper. The ARTEMIS application was the first application to rely on the objects developed within the HELIOS project and its successors. The HEGP Experience (1998-2013). \u201cAssistance Publique H\u00f4pitaux de Paris\u201d (APHP), the administrative umbrella for the 37 Paris University hospitals, was a large restructuring effort in the 1990\u2019s involving the closing of three aging facilities (Broussais, Boucicaut, and La\u00ebnnec to open the \u201cH\u00f4pital Europ\u00e9en Georges Pompidou\u201d (HEGP) university hospital located in southwest Paris. I had the chance and honor to be appointed in 1998 by the HEGP CEO, Louis Omn\u00e8s, as both CIO and CMIO and to carry out the IT strategic planning of this future hospital, and conduct European calls for proposals. A consortium of software providers under the coordination of the THALES group, a major army supplier, was selected for a long-term partnership with HEGP. A component-based architecture inspired by the European HISA architecture framework and the experience of Prof. Rudi van de Velde in AZBUB, Brussels was selected. The HEGP opened in July 2000 with a running clinical information system made up of four major health components: Patient identification and Admission Discharge Transfer (ID from THALES-ADT), a shared multimedia electronic heath record (EHR) and a computerized provider entry (CPOE) from MEDASY, and an appointment scheduling (AS), OneCall, from PerS\u00e9 Technology. Generic components included the Security Manager, the  Reference/Concept Manager, the Decision Rule Engine, and the Communications bus. A fifth component, the clinical data warehouse (CDW) based on i2b2 for phenotype data and tranSMART for omics data was later added (2008) to foster data reuse and translational research projects. Structured data carefully acquired since 1975 at St. Joseph and Broussais hospital were to be hopefully transferred to the HEGP CIS in 2000 and duplicated in the HEGP CDW in 2008 giving the unique opportunity to perform epidemiologic studies on a population for 80,000 patients with more than 45 years of follow up. Closing the loop (since 2014). The French system obliges us to relinquish operational responsibilities at the age of 65 in public hospitals and at 67 in public universities. This was an opportunity for me to pursue research and teaching activities that I was happy to embrace. With Master and PhD students, I decided to benefit from my early statistical experience to evaluate the impact of IT on hospital efficiency and the quality of both inpatient and outpatient care. Financial and quality indicators are built up from temporal data extracted from the HEGP but also the 37 university hospitals under the Paris APHP umbrella. We hope this work could give partial answers to key questions for the future of medical informatics: Do health professionals really use the information systems at their disposal? Does a meaningful use of information systems have a detectable effect on hospital financial efficiency and the quality of care delivered? Transmitting knowledge (since 1978). Fran\u00e7ois Gr\u00e9my was a wonderful teacher and textbook writer and all his colleagues remind his Hippocratic vision of knowledge transmission. I was given the chance in 1983 to co-coordinate his master\u2019s degree curriculum in Medical Informatics at the Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Medical School. When Fran\u00e7ois left Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re for Montpellier in 1990, we decided with Alain Venot (Paris Descartes) and Pierre Le Beux (Rennes) to create a national Master\u2019s and PhD curriculum involving colleagues who had strong relationships with Fran\u00e7ois. They included Prof. R. Beuscart (Lille), Prof. Ph. Cinquin (Grenoble), Prof. C. Quantin (Dijon), Prof. M. Fieschi (Marseille), and Dr. P. Zweigenbaum (Orsay). This Master and PhD curriculum is still active in with a professional alumni network of more than 400, and with several textbooks written and regularly updated. Lessons learned. For a former physician, like me, the magic of biomedical informatics starts when it can enter in the direct process of care management and patient involvement. Choosing between more applied informatics or a more theoretical path is a matter of personal choice. The hazards and opportunities arise from the human relationships that enlighten our professional lives. This can involve physicians dedicated to either generic or highly specialized medical fields like the ones I came to know well in nephrology and cardiology. This can involve those who search for new IT paradigms applicable in medicine and healthcare more generally. I must confess that I remain indebted to all the many marvelous people whom I have had the chance to meet and work with, and whom are just partially acknowledged in a short personal story such as this one. ", "Jaime Delgado": "PhD in Telecommunications Engineering (1987) Full Professor, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya (UPC) Barcelona (Spain), since 2007 Chair of the WG on Security (SSE), EFMI, since 2017 From standards & security to health informatics My background is Telecommunications Engineering. I studied at the Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya (UPC) in Barcelona (Spain). I finished my MSc (electronics specialty) in 1983 and my PhD in 1987. My PhD Thesis was on a storage service for mail management systems. I became an Associate Professor at the UPC in 1987, and continued working on distributed applications, participating in several European research projects. The key point at that time, and the principal one that years later led me to Medical Informatics, was \u201cstandardization\u201d. In 1990 I joined my first international standardization committee. It was an ISO Working Group (WG) when I joined, but then ISO and IEC created a Joint Technical Committee: ISO/IEC JTC1. My WG was part of subcommittee SC18 (on \u201cDocument processing and related communication\u201d, which no longer exists), and was the one in charge of developing the ODA (Open Document Architecture) standard for the representation and interchange of documents. During those years, I was assigned first as editor of one of the ODA parts, specifically, the \u201cDocument Profile\u201d, part 4. Then, I became the Editor responsible for part 3 on the Abstract Interface for the manipulation of ODA documents, and for part 12 on Identification of document fragments. ODA was ISO/IEC 8613 and ITU-T T.410, jointly developed by ISO/IEC and ITU-T. The three parts I edited were completed between 1994 and 1996. Since 1992, I was the Chair of the ad-hoc group on Document Manipulation. Unfortunately, the standard did not enjoy much success in the marketplace, so the group was disbanded in 1997. I remember its last meeting in Barcelona, which I was hosting, where I made the proposal to disband, since we were discussing new improvements to the standard, but this made no sense if the industry was not backing us. Working on the ODA standard was nevertheless a very interesting experience, and paved the way towards a new approach for research based on standards. Nine out of the 15 PhD Thesis I have advised since then have been significantly related to standardization work. Discontinuing the work on the ODA standard did not mean stopping research on how to represent, interchange and manipulate documents. By that time, I had already started to work on the specification of profiles (subsets of standards) in the context of EWOS (European Workshop for Open Systems), which, under the umbrella of the official CEN (Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en de Normalisation, European Committee for Standardization), contributed to many ISP (International Standardized Profiles). Being a member first of the Expert Group on ODA and afterwards of the WG on SMMI (Structured MultiMedia Information), I was directly involved in specifying profiles for ODA and other related standards, such as DFR (Document Filing and Retrieval). I edited  several profiles, including three (Read only AOD11, Insert AOD12 and Manipulation AOD13) on interactive manipulation of ODA documents (the 3 parts of ISO/IEC ISP 15121), in 1996, and three on document store manipulation (ADF13), Simple remote store management (ADF21) and Full remote store management (ADF22), all of them based on DFR (several parts of ISO/IEC ISP 12069), in 1998 and 1999. Although EWOS disappeared in 1997, a new organization took its place: CEN/ISSS (CEN/Information Society Standardization System). In fact, the work on DFR mentioned above was finished in the context of CEN/ISSS. In parallel to that work on document formats and management, I had started to do research on metadata, and I participated in the CEN/ISSS MMI (Metadata for Multimedia Information) team. In the 1990\u2019s I also contributed to several ITU-T standards (called them \u201cRecommendations\u201d), such as DTAM (Document Transfer and Manipulation, T.430) and, mainly, as Editor, some of the Recommendations in the T.190 series on Cooperative Document Handling. In particular, T.190, specifying Framework and Basic Services, and T.192, specifying Complex Services (Joint synchronous editing and joint document presentation/viewing), were both published in 1995. Last but not least in that decade, I participated, from 1993 to 1997, in another standardization organization, ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute), as Editor of two parts of the standard ETS 300 498, Open Document Architecture (ODA) Communication Services. Part 1 was on Basic Services, and part 2 on Complex Services. But, is all of these relevant to my work on medical informatics? In fact, yes. As I already indicated, \u201cstandardization\u201d has been key in my research, including medical informatics. The other key point will be security. EWOS created an Expert Group on healthcare (EG MED). Although I was mainly working in the EG ODA, EWOS EG MED called for a Project Team (PT032) to work on the interchange of multimedia information in medical applications. PTs were special openly-called funded activities to produce specific deliverables on focused topics. Since PT032 wanted to be multidisciplinary, I presented an offer to participate based on my experience on multimedia document formats, and I was selected as one of the four members. I was therefore one of the Editors of the EWOS Technical Guide N. 68 (ETG 68) on Multimedia Medical Data Interchange, the result of the PT work. This was in 1995 and 1996, but, unfortunately, there was no further continuation. However, my involvement in eHealth had already started by then. Around this time, a second key point what that I slowly extended my area of research from formats and metadata to security and, later, digital rights management and privacy. Again, medical informatics \u201ccrossed my way\u201d. This second time it was in the form of an important European project: MOBIHEALTH, started in 2002. However, before discussing this project, I need to explain my academic situation during the period. I continued as Associate Professor at the UPC, lecturing in the Telecommunications Engineering and Computer Science programs. However, when I left the UPC and moved to another university in Barcelona, the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF), to collaborate in the setting up of new engineering degrees, first in Informatics, and later in Telecommunications, I took the responsibility for the networking and computer architecture area. This happened in 1999, when I changed my research topics and created a new research group at the UPF. I was the Dean of the Faculty for a few years (2001-2004), but I left the UPF in 2006: This will come however later on. MOBIHEALTH (an acronym used later for different purposes) was the European Project IST-2001-36006, which ran from May 2002 until the end of 2003. This was a  short, though large (several million euros budget and 14 participants, including manufacturers, network providers, hospitals and universities) project on the development and improvement of mobile technologies for eHealth applications. My role was related to the integration of security. Medical informatics was there in my career to stay, although it was not my main topic yet. Once at the UPF, I got and managed several new European projects, such as VISNET (2003-2005), a European Network of Excellence on Networked Audiovisual Media Technologies, which had a continuation in VISNET-II (2006-2009), and a big European Integrated Project run in parallel (2004-2008): AXMEDIS (Aurating Production of Cross Media Content for Multi-channel Distribution). In this project, the contribution of my group was mainly on security issues, digital rights management, and metadata and protocols for multimedia content. All of them involved work going on in standardization, mainly in MPEG. Years after the major work on standards for document processing and metadata, I identified a new potential area for our research in the context of standards development: security for multimedia applications, since we already had some experience in security. The ISO/IEC JTC1 SC29/WG11 had developed years before the first successful MPEG standards, and had started to work on new specifications, including DRM (Digital Rights Management) as a key point for multimedia content management. I joined the MPEG WG in 2003 and I was still there in 2017. Since then, I have been very active working on different topics, starting with digital rights management (particularly, rights expression language profiles), then moving to developing a Contract Expression Language (CEL) and a corresponding ontology (MCO, Media Contract Ontology), multimedia content search, middleware for multimedia applications (MPEG-M), and some security improvements in different areas. Medical informatics, appeared, indirectly, in the MPEG WG in 2014 with the Ad hoc Group on Genomic Information Compression and Storage, which I co-chair. In parallel to MPEG, I also joined (2007) another WG of ISO/IEC JTC1 SC29, the WG1 on JPEG. My contributions in this WG were, at the beginning, on metadata and search, such as (Editor of some parts of) the JPSearch standard (ISO/IEC 24800), and now I am moving to security and privacy in JPEG images that is a new controversial topic to be standardized. This might seem far from medical informatics, but there is overlap on topics such as the protection of medical images and the definition of access rules to control who accesses the \"content structures\", which could be images, clinical documents or genomic information. Returning to academic issues - I had left the UPF in 2006, and then, although not initially planned, I came back to the UPC. I smoothly continued my research work with my research group, and continued teaching on the same range of subjects. I won a Full Professorship position in 2007 and I have stayed at the UPC since then. In the meantime the research around MPEG and JPEG, I took another important step towards medical informatics: I became member of HL7 International. As it is known in our area, HL7 International is one of the main SDO (Standards Developing Organizations) in the area of healthcare. Although very USA-oriented, most of the main actors in the digital healthcare industry and services are members of the organization. HL7 International has currently more than 1600 members from over 50 countries, and 34 affiliated countries. As they describe themselves, they are \u201cdedicated to providing a comprehensive framework and related standards for the exchange, integration, sharing, and retrieval of electronic health information that supports clinical practice and the  management, delivery and evaluation of health services\u201d. One of their most used result is the CDA (Clinical Document Architecture), a standard to represent clinical documents. There are more than 60 Work Groups (WG) in HL7 International. I joined the Security WG in 2010. At that time, between other projects, they were starting the definition of a Security and Privacy Ontology. This was the topic in which I contributed first, based on my previous experience on other kinds of ontologies. On the other hand, I learned a slightly different approach to standards development. At that time, at the start of the current decade, the main focus of my research was clearly moving to medical informatics, focusing on standards development, integration of security, provision of privacy and specification of formats to represent medical information. My academic and scientific career has been complemented in the last years with a few entrepreneurship activities. I started a couple of spin-off companies from the UPC. The most relevant one is the company Clinical Document Engineering (CDE), who is directly in the field of medical informatics. Although the company was formally created only in 2015, the ideas behind the service the company is selling started one year earlier. In one sentence, CDE has developed OpenCDE, a cloud-based service that allows health providers (mainly hospitals) to automatically generate HL7 CDA clinical documents from their information systems. Then, health professionals and patients may access, from everywhere, applying the necessary privacy rules, the documents they have authorization. Also in 2015, I joined the EFMI (European Federation for Medical Informatics) and the WG on Security (SSE \u2013 Security, Safety and Ethics). I was elected co-chair of the WG SSE in 2015, and Chair later on (formally confirmed in 2017). As mentioned before, I am currently working on the standardization of the secure and compressed representation of genomic information. The standard, to be ISO/IEC 23092, and known as MPEG-G, is being developed by the MPEG standardization committee (due to its expertise in compression, formats, systems and security), in collaboration with experts in the fields of genomics, bioinformatics and biotechnology (represented by ISO/TC 276). After a deep requirements\u2019 gathering process, a Call for Proposals was issued in 2016. From the 15 answers to the Call, a standard with five parts is being developed since then. The five parts are: Format, Encoding, Metadata and APIs, Reference Software and Conformance. They were already in the first formal steps to become official final standards by the end of 2018. A clear direction for future work in this research is the integration of the genomic information with medical information, coming back again to medical informatics. As a summary of my story, I have been mainly working in medical informatics during this decade, although I had two initial important steps in the 1990s and at the beginning of the century. My road to medical informatics is based on two pillars: standardization and security. The first isolated steps were directly related to these two topics (a standardization work on medical information formats, and a European project on security for mobile health applications). Currently, I am working on both at the same time, mainly standardizing (and implementing) security aspects of health information. ", "Jacques Demongeot": "Professor University of Grenoble Trajectory of Jacques Demongeot After an initial professional experience as Artillery lieutenant and engineer at ESA (European Space Agency) at Villingen and Darmstadt (Germany) between 1967 and 1969, during which I was introduced to the numerical calculation of trajectories of observation satellites using \u00ae the first formal software FORMAC , I discovered medical informatics in Grenoble in the early 70s. Between 1965 and 1970, the growth of large computing and management machines in the academic and industrial world, as well as the development of the first data base management systems (DBMS) using the concepts of first hierarchical and, later networked DBMS, convincing some doctors, mostly internists, that such tools were available for the development of Hospital Information Systems \u00ae (HIS). Dr. J. Valois was the initiator of the DOSTAM system in Grenoble, using the \u00ae Socrate DBMS, created by J.R. Abrial, Professor at the Institute of Informatics and Applied Mathematics of Grenoble (IMAG), system on which R.B. Fetter developed the concept of Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) for classifying hospital cases. In parallel, \u00ae H.R. Warner had designed the HELP system in Salt Lake City, where the first large databases were structured, based on the joint work of M.H. Skolnick (University of Utah) \u00ae and Y. Chiaramella (IMAG), while J. Scherrer created the DIOGENE system in \u00ae \u00ae Geneva, P. Lenoir the ADM system in Rennes, and A.R. Bakker the BAZIS system in Leiden. Initial enthusiasm was tempered by three factors, which led to an apparent skepticism in the late 1970s due to the \u2022 primacy given by the administrative staff to immediate management information systems (payroll, invoicing, personnel management, inventory management, etc.) \u2022 complexity and hard work needed to build and maintain the first medical applications (exit summaries, universal and exhaustive coding attempts, medical decision support systems, etc.) \u2022 native distrust of medical users in relation to a centralized system. \u00ae For these reasons, in the 1980s, we designed and developed the HIS Cristalnet , in a relational DBMS framework, covering the main clinical processes from the care units to emergency units, with a special focus given to PACS (Picture Archiving & \u00ae Communication Systems), in partnership with industrial companies such as DEC and \u00ae Atos Origin . Then, our research in theoretical biology and complex systems theory (at TIMC-IMAG laboratory of Joseph Fourier University Grenoble, I created and managed from 1984 to 2010) led us to model patient centered medical information outside the hospital universe, particularly at the patient's home, with a more preventive and curative public health perspective. For that purpose, 22 years ago we developed a smart and flat system (the second in the world) for the surveillance of elderly or people suffering from  chronic pathologies. This research into in-home surveillance was developed by adhering to three criteria: (i) temporality, (ii) complexity, and (iii) non invasivity. A person at such a time of life can now benefit from non-intrusive monitoring tools, favoring a return to their home and ongoing maintenance there, leading to a corresponding increase in the quality of life, and effective longevity, while respecting the ethics of the individual and the family. If the above conditions are met, collaboration between gerontologists, social scientists and ICT specialists allows to revisit the DRG concept, by generalizing the allocating those in homecare to homogeneous classes of risk \u00ae \u00ae and monitoring procedures, using more WHO ICF than WHO ICD for an effectively optimal economic and human cost. This implies introducing new concepts like the emergence of typical health trajectories in a complex environment, social interactions networks, homeostasis of the health care system, etc. These concepts are largely identical to those developed to study the regulation of biological systems (genetic, metabolic or physiological), which allows us to expect in the future a re-engineering of common observation, storage and prediction tools, from the molecular to the population scale. ", "Georges De Moor": "Former Head, Department of Medical Informatics & Medical Statistics, Ghent University Chair, Belgian Society for Medical Informatics (MIM) MD, PhD, Ghent University, Belgium It was a mere whim of fate, a motorcycle accident when I was 21 years old and studying medicine, that indirectly determined the course of my career. During the intervals between several surgical procedures that lasted for nearly a year, I took the opportunity to work as an assistant lecturer in the clinical pathology laboratory of Ghent University Hospital. The director of the lab was Professor Roger Wieme, who also headed the department of Medical Informatics. He became my mentor, together with Dr. Jan Van Egmond of the same department, who founded the Belgian Society for Medical Informatics (MIM) in 1974 and was the co-founder of the European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) in 1976. Sadly, Jan passed away during a stay in Boston a few years later. Although I subsequently specialised in Laboratory Medicine and Nuclear Medicine in Vitro, it was in Medical Information Science that in 1994 I was awarded a PhD for a dissertation entitled \u201cTowards a European Standard for Electronic Data Interchange in Laboratory Medicine\u201d. This dissertation was the outcome of my coordination of EUCLIDES, the first pan-European project I worked on during the course of the Second Framework R&D Programme of the European Commission. The EC officers recognised the potential of my work and suggested that I should develop it into an actual official European Standard. However, at that time there was no official Technical Committee (TC) in Health Informatics Standardisation in Europe. It followed that I took it upon myself to found such a Technical Committee in CEN (Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en de Normalisation, European Standardisation Committee). When CEN TC251 was established, it was given a budget from the EC Directorate General 3 that funded hundreds of experts from 19 different countries. I had the honour of chairing CEN TC251 for at least 7 years. My PhD dissertation and the EUCLIDES project also led to the establishment of both the EUCLIDES Foundation International (EFI) and a spin-off company called MediBridge, a value-added network service provider. The latter is still in existence. One of the deliverables from the EUCLIDES project, i.e. its multi-axial coding scheme, has also served as a major input to the now well-known LOINC system that is used as the International Coding Standard in Lab Information Systems. I worked on this with friends and colleagues from the US, especially Clement MacDonald, of the Regenstrief Institute in Indianapolis. In order to facilitate the administrative and scientific organisation of all these standardisation activities, I founded RAMIT (Research in Advanced Medical Informatics and Telematics), a nonprofit organisation within the structure of Ghent University. RAMIT has also been instrumental in conducting a great many other research and standardization projects. As a consequence of all the above I have for many years combined several activities:  \u2022 In Clinical Pathology, heading a lab in Brussels and chairing the National Committees on Reimbursement and Quality Assessment. \u2022 In Medical Informatics and Statistics, as head of the Department of Medical Informatics at Ghent University and long-time chair of the Belgian Society for Medical Informatics (MIM). \u2022 In e-Health Research, as head of RAMIT. \u2022 In Health ICT standardization, as founding chairman of CEN TC 251. \u2022 In business, as the founder of companies such as MediBridge. Cross-fertilisation between the different layers of activity (academic teaching, research, standardization activities, and business) has proved to be beneficial for overall development and growth. More particularly, all these enterprises together have resulted in over 40 European standards (ENs, ENVs, or TRs) with participation in, and the coordination of over 130 nd th funded Research Projects (from the 2 to the 8 European Framework Programme) and in more than 200 publications in peer reviewed scientific journals and books. In 2005 I was awarded the International Rory O\u2019Moore Medal for Medical Informatics, presented in Dublin by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern. Together with Ilias Iakovidis, EC Officer in DG Information Society and Media, I drafted a Memorandum of Understanding between the US Department of Health and Human Services and the European Commission, on \u201cCooperation surrounding Health th related Information and Communication Technologies\u201d. It was signed on 17 December 2010 by Kathleen G. Sebelius, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services and Neelie Kroes, Vice-President of the European Commission. It was published in \u201cTransatlantic Cooperation Surrounding Health Related Information and Communication Technology\u201d (Ed. Georges J.E. De Moor, with a preface by Herman Van Rompuy, President of the European Council, IOS Press, ISBN 978-1-60750-809-0). In 2013 I was appointed an official member of the Advisory Group of the EC Horizon 2020 R&D Programme, chapter \u201cHealth, Demographic Change and Wellbeing\u201d. Further accomplishments include the creation of: The Microsoft Healthcare Industry Users\u2019 Group (MS HUGE) (founding chairman from 1999-2005). EuroRec, a European not for profit Association promoting the use of high quality Electronic Health Records in Europe (http://www.eurorec.org). Custodix, a private company dealing with privacy protection and offering platform services for the re-use of health data for clinical research (http://www.custodix.com). This platform was the outcome of the EC Project EHR4CR (European Health Records for Clinical Research. I-HD, the European Institute for Innovation through Health Data, dealing with governance of new ecosystems when (re-)using health data (http://www.i-hd.eu) (Dipak Kalra, President). I can remark that the above achievements have not come from any personal ambition or deliberate strategy. They merely reflect an attitude of being unable to say no to new requests, exciting challenges and promising opportunities! The only genuinely conscious decision in my career was to keep my activities explicitly dual, i.e. medicine on the one hand and informatics on the other. As for the future, I can envisage unstoppable progress when \u201cdata, information, knowledge\u201d, together with artificial intelligence, force us into a revolution in which  digital systems develop from processing to thinking, and even to judging. Let us hope that as we undergo these far-reaching and continuous changes, we as humans remain able to retain enough wisdom to ensure sensible governance of the emerging ecosystems. Unlike some of my colleagues I have never regarded my professional activities as a hobby. My father used to see this as an advantage, as it allows us to pay significant attention to other fields. As far as I am concerned this includes an interest in living beings, nature and gardening, poetry, philosophy, religion, and\u2026even\u2026motorcycling, which takes me back to the beginning of my story!

At some universities, computer science has been linked to electrical engineering, but at RWTH Aachen University, where I started my academic education, computer science is linked to the mathematicians and the Faculty of Science. So, my education was on electricity and circuits, synchronous and asynchronous electrical engines and generators, high voltage systems, electrical waves, Maxwell\u2019s equations, and how the electrical field looks like within a rectangular hollow conductor. Not much of computers and algorithms so far, but in later semesters, I\u2019d enjoyed the lectures on signal transmission and coding. 1989, the sampling theorem of Nyquist was fascinating me: If there is distinct information in analogue form (signal), you can sample it to make it digital, a necessity for any automatic processing. However, if not enough samples are taken, some information gets lost. With a certain sample rate, digital and analogue signals become equivalent, but getting more samples will not get you more or better information; it just blows up the file size. This insight, I got 25 years ago, and I still smile when students send me their CVs with scanned documents in PDF files of 10 or 20 megabytes\u2026 1990, the straightforward way was specializing in communication engineering, signal processing, digital signal processing, and I finally ended with digital image processing. 1991, at the end of my studies, I was seeking a topic of my Diploma Thesis. So many options, but one was on photographs of the eyes of infants allowing the physicians to quickly and reliably detect and quantify squinting. That was cool: research, innovative, and helping people. I definitely preferred that topic over vision systems for unmanned vehicles that were being developed by the military at that time. Consequently, I even delayed my studies to wait for that topic to be available (the advisor was away for a long trip), and carried out my thesis on medical imaging. Actually, medical image processing is considered one of the core disciplines in medical informatics (Pommerening et al., Inform Spektr 2014; 37 (in German)). 1992, working on the thesis, I got in contact with physicians. Wow, talking to physicians was different. And again, I was fascinated. I became aware that well educated people such as doctors and technical specialists can misunderstand each other completely when they talk about technical systems and requirements. There is a famous quote from Henry Ford: \u201cIf I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses\u201d. So, I needed to learn how physicians are used to thinking, and how to explain  the potential of the new imaging technologies. That helped me to complete my thesis successfully developing an algorithm that met all their requirements. 1992, I got a PhD position at the hospital of RWTH Aachen University with the Department of Medical Statistics and Documentation, as It was called at that time. Luckily, I\u2019d had excellent teachers in my first years as a PhD student. Walter, for instance, is an electrical engineer and dentist who helped me understand how medical people think and work. I learned that you need to understand their needs to successfully provide technical solutions that really work and get applied. And I have learned that you need more than one physician to talk with, because physicians usually have a way of talking that might lead the uninitiated to think that their personal views are actually laws of nature! With Walter, we developed free-hand subtraction radiography and applied the algorithms to intra-oral radiographs acquired from direct-digital sensors that came onto the market in the early nineties. In 1992, I also attended my first scientific conference on pattern recognition. There were interesting presentations, comparable to the work that I had done, and I decided to submit my Diploma work for presentation at the following year\u2019s conference. 1993, my paper was accepted and orally presented by myself with passion, showing my fascination for the field of medical informatics. Unexpectedly, the paper was awarded the First Prize of the German Association for Pattern Recognition. This of course helped define my academic career, with medical image processing as my field of research. However, I didn\u2019t seek to become a professor, but rather spent my time on different projects selected for their fun and my personal preferences, rather than by strategy. 1998, I finally completed my PhD. However, I decided to submit it to the Faculty of Science and not to the Faculty of Electrical Engineering. This was a distinctive decision to express my identity as a medical informatician, since I had the option to continue my research as a post-doc in my same department, that had meanwhile be renamed as the Department of Medical Informatics. My research was concentrated until then on knowledge and communication, and, although I completed my projects producing efficient and effective algorithms, the solutions did not find their way into routine use. 2004, my habilitation in Medical Informatics was submitted to the Medical School, of RWTH Aachen University. In this thesis, I went from knowledge and communication skills to understanding medical and clinical workflows and integrating functionality into these workflows. \u201cThe right information at the right time at the right place\u201d is a frequently- quoted phrase by Peter L. Reichertz, the German medical informatician who pioneered electronic documentation in healthcare, in order to describe the general aims of medical informatics, which sometimes is extended by: \u201cto the right person in the right format\u201d \u2013 the 5 Rs. Medical informatics is more than an algorithm for automated image analysis. The algorithms must be usable by physicians from their work- place, the images to be processed must be available and the results of processing must be stored back to an archive and linked with the originals. I have learned that Medical Informatics is much more about integration of data, with functional, contextual, and visual levels. 2008, I became full professor of Medical Informatics at the medical school of RWTH Aachen university, which has been renamed to Uniklinik RWTH Aachen now. My focus of research moved from image analysis to image and data management. Specifically, I have been developing information systems and protocols to support clinicians in performing controlled clinical trials as an important component of medical research. So, it is research on how to improve medical research using novel computer technology. And again, an insight I got that is fascinating to me is the following: the needed information systems are basically available as components, but interconnecting  these systems well is still a challenge. In computer science, open source toolkits are available for almost any problem, but you need to combine the modules and transfer the data between the systems. 2017, the directorship of the Peter L. Reichertz Institute for Medical Informatics, University of Braunschweig \u2013 Institute of Technology and Hannover Medical School, at the site Braunschweig was offered to me, unexpectedly. As far as I know, risk and chance are the same word in Chinese. Although quite settled in Aachen, my entire family moved with me to the Braunschweig / Hannover area. We took the chance and did not worry about the risks, and as of now, we do not regret this. 2019, the IMIA Working Group on Accident & Emergency Informatics has been established successfully, and the German State of Lower Saxony has provided essential funding to establish an International Standard Accident Number (ISAN). PLRI is now working on information exchange between the alerting smart home, the rescue team, and the emergency department. The goal is to exchange floor plans, a front door\u2019s key codes, and other valuable information securely to we can improve or speed up the care given to those in need. So, I can look back to more than 25 years of continuously transforming myself into a medical informatician. The only thing I know for sure is that this transformation has not yet finished, and medical informatics is a fascinating field to work in, as practitioner, teacher, as well as researcher. Journal of Digital Imaging, 2009; 22:202-215 ", "Gjuro De\u017eeli\u0107": "Permanent BMHI Professor, School of Medicine, Zagreb University Specialized in BMHI in USA, Italy, UK, France, Belgium, Japan Founder: Croatian Society for Medical Informatics Member of IMIA and EFMI, as well as of Unesco My start in biomedical and health informatics (BMHI) came at a time when computers were increasingly applied in medicine and healthcare. Working since 1964 as an assistant professor at the Department of Applied Biochemistry of the Andrija \u0160tampar School of Public Health (SPH), as part of the School of Medicine of the University of Zagreb, I was engaged in physico-chemical research of particulate matter influencing health. Back then such materials, nowadays called nanoparticles, were called colloids and/or macromolecules. Since in this type of research both mathematical and experimental methods are applied, being well acquainted with statistical theory, I was also asked to teach statistics to medical students. As the rapid development of computer technologies in the second half of the past century demanded their use as well in both research and practice, my whole work soon involved using computers on a daily basis. My professional experience with computers received a considerable boost when the very next year I received a Fulbright Fellowship to travel to visit Indiana University (IU) in the U.S.A. Soon after arriving in Bloomington, in March 1965, I was able to start working at the IU Computing Centre, where a big, new CDC 3600 batch-mode computer system was available on an \u201copen shop basis\u201d. This made my research at IU not only more productive, but allowed me to also expand my knowledge and practice in mathematical statistics by Dixon\u00b4s Biomedical Computer Programs package developed just a year earlier at UCLA. At the same time, in the IU libraries I found information on important new computer-based projects in biomedicine and healthcare, including MEDLARS (1963), LINC (1962), and DENDRAL (1965). I became aware that a new era of information processing in medicine and health care had already started and that these new methods would have to be taught to medical students and healthcare personnel. Returning home in 1966 to the SPH, supported by the director of SPH Prof. Branko Kesi\u0107, a visionary who recognised the importance of BMHI for the development of medicine and healthcare, I was immediately requested to start teaching these new subjects to postgraduate students. A few years later, in 1970, compulsory teaching in BMHI has been expanded to all medical students, both at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels as well as to continuing education courses for other health personnel. During this ten-year period, my teaching materials reached maturity and in 1976 I published them in form of a BMHI university textbook with the title \u201cFundamentals of Informatics\u201d (after several editions this textbook\u2019s title became \u201cMedical Informatics\u201d in 1997.) My involvement with informatics advanced rather fast. In 1971, a large University Computing Center was established in Zagreb (UCC), intended to support informatics development in Croatia, primarily in the field of research and education, but for other non-commercial projects. I participated in the conceptual design of UCC as a member of  group of twelve professionals working in medicine and healthcare. The result was the installation of a large mainframe in 1972 - a UNIVAC 1110 - to serve a network of terminals connecting all universities and the most important research institutes in Croatia, including the Zagreb School of Medicine, where my SPH had connections through interactive terminals from June 1973. At that time, I was still very active in my primary research field \u2013 the physical chemistry of macromolecules, conducting several research projects and becoming one of the founders and first director of Postgraduate Studies in the macromolecular sciences at the University of Zagreb (1971 to 1974). However, as a consequence of BMHI advances, during the 1970\u2019s, both at home and internationally, I gradually switched to BMHI, being especially engaged in projects for developing domestic integrated health information systems. The opening of the UCC terminal station at my SPH attracted interest of a number of young collaborators who chose the field of BMHI as their lifelong professions. Among several of my excellent earliest collaborators were my successors in the chair of BMHI at the Zagreb School of Medicine \u2013 Josipa Kern and Jadranka Bo\u017eikov. We started participating in domestic and international conferences on general informatics (the term informatique, meaning information processing by computers, was coined by Philippe Dreyfus in 1962, and called \u201cInformatica\u201d in Bled (Slovenia) and \u201cComputer at the University\u201d in Cavtat (Croatia). Among our early papers presented at these conferences which provoked much interest were those describing our original interactive program package for data analysis by statistical methods in biomedical research (we named it SPAK), which was warmly accepted by the users of our interactive terminals in the pre- PC era. In the second half of the seventies, the founding of the European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) gave another impetus to my activities in BMHI. At the first Medical Informatics Europe Congress in Cambridge in 1978, I came into contact with a broader circle of colleagues from many European countries and participated as an observer at early EFMI Council meetings (representing the former Yugoslav federation, in which Croatia was one of federal republics). Collaboration with EFMI continued at the 2nd EFMI Congress \u2013 Medical Informatics Berlin held in 1979. After more than a decade of BMHI teaching I was invited to present our experience to this international panel. I could report that our systematic teaching activities attracted students for fruitful and active cooperation both at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels and was part of the standard curricula at our medical schools. The way to a wide use of BMHI methods in the daily practice of physicians and other healthcare professionals as well as the development of health information systems in Croatia was now open. For me, the importance of the Berlin congress lies also in the fact that at its margins IMIA, after its transformation from the IFIP TC4 in 1978, held its second General Conference. Since I already had observer status at the EFMI Council, I was granted the same status for the IMIA Council. The development of BMHI in my country continued to advance. At the beginning of the eighties we engaged in research projects devoted to the development of health information systems, databases, the role of microcomputer technology in health applications and modelling, as well as in computer simulation of the dynamics of infectious diseases in the population. All that brought me to devote myself fully to BMHI.  nd Panel on MI education at 2 EFMI Congress \u2013 Medical Informatics Berlin \u201979; from the right: Gj. De\u017eeli\u0107 (Croatia, Yugoslavia), J. M\u00f6hr (Germany), C.J. Dickinson (Great Britain, not sitting at table), K. Adlassnig (Austria), F. Roger France (Belgium), and J. Anderson (Great Britain) Thus the spark, which struck the fire for the early BMHI teaching in Croatia in the mid-sixties, led less than two decades later to a new opportunity. The number of people working in the BMHI field had reached the critical level for establishing a national BMHI organisation capable of organizing domestic conferences and workshops as well as helping establish official international contacts. The support came from the Croatian Medical Association in establishing a Section of Medical Informatics in 1983, chaired by Marija Strnad. The Section brought together virtually all the experts in this area, from doctors of various specialties to other university-educated people. A few years later, as MI became a topic of increased interest in the medical community in Croatia, the Croatian Association of Healthcare Institutions (CAHI) organized in 1986 the first \u201cMeeting of Informatics in Healthcare\u201d (MIH). In the same year we started the Postgraduate Course \"Health Information Systems\" at the School of Medicine in Zagreb, which enrolled physicians, dentists and pharmacists, but also other professions (economists, engineers etc.). As its originator I was its first director until 1993, when Josipa Kern took over until 1997, when it concluded after a reorganization of postgraduate studies at the School of Medicine. For the ten years it was in operation, the MIH enrolled about 120 postgraduate students (including some from the other republics of the former Yugoslavia), leading to 22 master theses. At the 2nd MIH in May 1987, CAHI founded its Committee for Health Informatics (CHI), which I chaired. The CHI continued to organize BMHI conferences with participants from other parts of the former Yugoslavia and abroad (especially BMHI experts from the so-called \u201cAlpe-Adria Region\u201d, consisting of geographically relevant parts of Austria, Germany, Italy and Ex-Yugoslavia), and was entrusted with the mandate of representing Yugoslav BMHI professionals in EFMI and IMIA, until an association at the federal level could be formed. In IMIA I had the status of a \u201ccorresponding member\u201d. After the 3rd MIH in May 1988, autonomous BMHI societies started to form in Yugoslavia. The Croatian CHI was transformed into the Croatian Society for Medical  Informatics (CSMI) established on February 16, 1989. Such societies were also formed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia and Serbia. So the prerequisites to establish the Yugoslav Association for Medical Informatics (YAMI) were fulfilled. This happened in June 1989 at the founding assembly of YAMI in Osijek (Croatia). YAMI\u00b4s seat was in Zagreb, and I was elected YAMI president. Izet Ma\u0161i\u0107 (Bosnia and Herzegovina), Rajko Vuka\u0161inovi\u0107 (Serbia) and \u0160tefan Adami\u010d (Slovenia) served as YAMI\u00b4s Board members. The road to join EFMI and IMIA officially was now open. But the political changes in Europe at the beginning of 1990\u2019s led to Yugoslavia\u00b4s dissolution and YAMI also ceased to exist. Following the recognition of the Republic of Croatia by the international community as a sovereign independent country, CSMI was accepted by IMIA as its th regular member society. This took place at the MEDINFO 1992 in Geneva (on 5 September). From that date, as CSMI\u00b4s president, I continued to serve as representative of Croatia to IMIA until 1994, when Josipa Kern took over this duty. In the same year CSMI recognized my pioneering work in BMHI by electing me as its honorary president. Since 2010, Mira Hercigonja-Szekeres has been CSMI\u00b4s representative to IMIA. From the perspective of the present, as I write this text, it can be argued that the half- decennial development of BMHI in Croatia, initiated by me and my colleagues significantly added to the overall development of Croatian medicine and healthcare. This has been thoroughly described and analyzed in a recent paper describing the current status of computerization of the Croatian healthcare system and the BMHI education program which follows the IMIA recommendations. Under the auspices of the Croatian Academy of Medical Sciences, members of CSMI elaborated a comprehensive \u201cDeclaration on eHealth\u201d, which was the basis of the \u201cNational Health Development Strategy for the period 2012-2020\u201d issued by the Croatian Ministry of Health and the Croatian Health Insurance Fund. This strategy recognizes the information and communication technology as a priority means to achieve eHealth. It clearly states that building of systems in eHealth must be done by experts working in health institutions, i.e. by medical practitioners, lawyers, economists and BMHI specialists who know the existing business processes, and in collaboration with other IT specialists. Coming back to my beginnings in BMHI and summarizing what has been achieved during all these years in its development, both at the international and domestic levels, I am glad to note that the present state of this discipline, to which I devoted a great part of my life, fulfilled expectations expressed by my words published almost fifty years ago: \u201cIn conclusion it should be noted that computers today have already penetrated into all areas of medicine and health care. They became to such extent necessary and important in everyday use, that they are symbolizing the level of the development of modern medicine. For us it is essential at this moment to embed them into our healthcare system to ensure further development of our medical science and profession.\u201d ", "Francis Timothy de Dombal (1937 \u2013 1995)": "By Susan Clamp Professor F. Timothy de Dombal (Tim to all st who knew him) died suddenly on December 31 , 1995. When I was asked to write a short biography which would encompass not only the scientist but the man as a whole, I was not sure where to begin. Having worked closely with him for over 20 years I know he had many different roles. He was a doctor, a teacher, an information scientist, a motor sport enthusiast, a jazz pianist, a (rather erratic) golfer, a dedicated family man and, always, a loyal friend. However, whatever the role the qualities he brought to it were always the same. It would be easy for me just to list the qualities I thought he had but, true to my background in Information Science, instead I looked through the many letters and messages sent to the Unit after Tim\u2019s death to find out what other people felt and it was these words that were repeated again and again: Enthusiastic, Generous, Dedicated, Honest, Innovative, Knowledgeable, Humorous, Loyal. All these words were used many times by friends and colleagues to describe him, and all were true. Born in Sheffield, England, in 1937, son of a General Practitioner, he graduated from Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1958. He arrived in Leeds in 1963 to work as a house surgeon and later as researcher and clinical assistant in the University Department of Surgery at Leeds General Infirmary. He was quickly marked out as a first-rate research worker and outstanding communicator. Although he trained as a surgical registrar and obtained the Fellowship with the Royal College of Surgeons, he continued to develop ideas in what was to become the field of Medical Informatics and Decision Making. His distinguished contribution to clinical medicine and science was recognised by the University of Leeds which made him Reader in Clinical Information Science in 1975, Director of the Clinical Information Science Unit in 1987 and awarded him a personal Chair in Medical Information Science in 1991. The formation and success of the Clinical Information Science Unit (CISU) was of utmost importance to him and the belief that the sensible application of Information Science in clinical medicine would result in improved clinical performance and better patient care was the founding belief behind the Unit. However, one of Tim\u2019s great strengths was that he was a doctor first, a medical informatician second and a computer enthusiast last. This meant that all the research carried out by the Unit always started on the basis of benefit for patients and doctors. One of his favourite phrases was \u2013 \u2018doctors doctor, computers compute\u2019 \u2013 each has their own different strengths and the key is to make the best use of those strengths. A belief which Tim did not just confine to doctors and computers but to all aspects of his life. Although he continued to make major contributions to medicine in Leeds and Yorkshire through his links with colleagues in the teaching and regional hospitals, with whom he published important papers on the computer-aided diagnosis of abdominal pain,  gastro-intestinal bleeding and the earlier diagnosis of cancer, he became an increasingly important figure in European and world gastroenterology, becoming Chairman of the Research Committee of the World Organisation of Gastroenterology (OMGE) in 1982. Over a 20-year period, he and his Committee and a large band of active collaborators pursued clinical, epidemiological and health service research and surveys based on the use of Clinical Information Science. The outcome has been monumental multinational surveys on inflammatory bowel disease (5,000 patients with a total of 10,000 years of prospective review), acute abdominal pain (a database of 77,000 patients) and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (5,000 patients). The strength of these studies was that they included data from both the developed countries and the newly emerging nations. At the time Tim was also forging strong links with telematics research in Europe. He was founding member of the European Society for Medical Decision Making and of the European Society for Engineering and Medicine, of which he became Secretary General. He was the project leader of two successful European Concerted Actions belonging to the BIOMED programme, and a major participant in many European AIM and Health Care Telematics projects of DG X111, including TELEGASTRO, EDUCTRA and its spin-off ELITE, EPISTOL, ELCANO, ECOLE/GRIP and MEDICO. Through these European and international links, Tim built a network of enthusiastic and interested colleagues, involving clinicians, statisticians, medical informaticians and computer experts (many of whom became not just colleagues but lasting friends) bringing together clinical and telematics research in a unique way. He also put an enormous amount of energy into disseminating the results from this research and did so not only in the usual ways (450 papers, 10 books and innumerable lectures) but also through the development of educational computer programs which were distributed world-wide, particularly to the developing countries, where he believed they could be of great benefit. His achievements were therefore many but if I was asked to use one word to describe him it would have to be \u2018Teacher\u2019 because above all that was his forte. He was a spellbinding lecturer and like all the best teachers he had an ability to impart not only knowledge but also enthusiasm about his chosen subject to others, no matter at what level from first year medical students to consultants and discipline experts, and being the teacher he was he would expect those of us who are left to continue his work. Tim de Dombal could perhaps best be described as a vital force. He inspired fierce loyalty in his colleagues and juniors and was incapable of being dull. Always assertive, positive, subversive and frequently controversial, he was the grit in the oyster, a man who challenged others to work harder, if only to try and disprove his hypotheses. He was a rare human being who will be much missed. ", "Rolf Engelbrecht": "Chair, EFMI-Health Information Management in Europe Associate Professor Medical Information Systems, State University of Medicine & Pharmacy, Moldova Former Head, Department of Medical Information Systems, Helmholtz Center, Munich Past President, European Federation of Medical Informatics (EFMI) Founding Member, EuroMISE, Prague I read electrical engineering and economics at the Leibniz University, Hannover. Over the years my interests and activities evolved with advances in research and and new technological trends. After completing my studies and receiving an Engineering Diploma, I began my professional career at the Medical School Hannover (MHH) in the newly established department for clinical informatics headed by Peter L. Reichertz. I assisted in the development of the MSH (Medical System Hannover) \u2013 the integrated system for medical management, hospital administration and university administration. As Head of the department of Administrative Systems in the research institute I designed the detailed plans for patient administration (ADT, food management), personnel management, stock management and student management. Under the guidance of Peter Reichertz I wrote my dissertation on the topic of coding medical diagnoses in collaboration with Professor Lothar H\u00fcbl from the Technical University of Hannover. Hannover was an early center of medical informatics with considerable impact nationally and internationally. The institute was also responsible for teaching at MHH and TU Braunschweig. An international summer school on medical informatics, a GMDS national conference, and several presentations organized at MHH and national and international presentations and publications were my next professional steps. This was prior to becoming Head of the Medical Information Systems Department at the GSF Research Center for Environment and Health, in Munich, later named the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Health which was part of the largest research network in Germany (where each institution is funded 90% by the Federal government and 10% by the state where it is located, in this case, Bavaria). The research was organized as departments within institutes such as MEDIS, which comprised medical information systems, image processing, statistics, epidemiology, operations research, biometry, social sciences plus a computer centre for the medical university. This proved to be an excellent way to carry out interdisciplinary projects across several departments. At the national level, the role of MEDIS was to organize working groups and projects, while at the international level the focus was on European as well as other worldwide activities. I have authored and edited more than 200 articles and books in the field of medical informatics and served on editorial boards of a number of scientific journals. I started new conferences which later continued as a series for several years, with some still proceeding to the present. These included Telemed Berlin, EFMI-STC (Special Topic Conference), Konline at the SYSTEMS fair in Munich. I have been President as well as Press and Information-Officer of EFMI (European Federation for Medical Informatics), and Vice President of IMIA (International Medical Informatics Association), and Vice President of the EuroRec Institute (European Institute for Health Records) in Brussels. I am an honorary member of the Romanian Academy of Medical Sciences and several  European scientific societies. In 2005 I was elected an International Affiliate of ACMI (American College of Medical Informatics). I was also a founding member of the European Centre for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology (EuroMISE) in Prague as well as a founding member of the Koch-Metschnikow-Forum in Berlin/St. Petersburg. L. to R.: Rolf Engelbrecht, John Mantas, Jan van Bemmel, Izet Ma\u0161i\u0107, MEDINFO, Copenhagen July 2013 Rolf Englebrecht, IMIA General Assembly, Rome, 2003 ", "Marius Fieschi": "Professor of Medical Informatics, Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine, Marseilles Head, Medical Information Department, Assistance Publique des H\u00f4pitaux de Marseille My first encounter with the world of computers dates back to 1971 as I was completing my Ph.D. in Physics on the physical and electrical properties of a semiconductor in thin layer deposits. It so happened, that in order to complete my project with modelling and simulation studies, I registered for a new course on computation and data processing that was being taught at the Faculty of Sciences I used to attend. As a result of this, I could happily make use of the IBM 1130 of the computer center of the Faculty. Right away, I was literally overwhelmed by both the possibilities and the new perspectives this machine was opening up for me to discover. It naturally followed that my time dedicated to computer science and data processing soon took over my original interest and longing for my studies in physics. I was first introduced to the medical world when I started working as an engineer at the University of Bordeaux II when a bacteriologist asked for my help in handling antibiogram data. This practitioner had many opportunities to point out my lack of understanding of the complexity of the living world and of the vocabularies or terminologies of knowledge that were so very different from the ones I had come to be acquainted with when studying the physical sciences. I then felt very strongly that I would never be able to achieve any genuine progress in this field unless I acquired a deeper and thorough medical knowledge. In 1974, it was in this spirit and frame of mind that I took up a position at the Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine in Marseilles; joining the team of Professor Michel Roux who had founded one of the very first French medical informatics teams. Through him I was given the opportunity to carry out the project I had in mind and thus started studying medicine. The aim of the team I had joined was mainly focused on setting up the necessary tools to manage medical files and to provide a decision aid for the diagnosis of thyroid pathologies. Our team was standing a little bit apart from most of the teams involved in the field of decision-making using probabilities theory and Bayes\u2019 theorem. It concentrated its research work on the use of the Boolean algebra and then propositional logic for the diagnosis process assistance. At that time, the limited capabilities of computers restricted our capacity for designing the software and applications (e.g. numerical calculation prevailed, transactional data processing was non-existent; batch processing, data entries using punched cards, were other shortcomings at the time). These drawbacks pressed upon us the need to model decision processes in a perfunctory way, in other words all that was very unsophisticated. The somehow na\u00efve and digital approach to information modeling prevailed, and numerical data was the primary object of research in that field. The proximity of Professor Alain Colmerauer's team (he was the inventor of the Prolog language), and the exchanges we had with members of his group involved in AI research in Marseilles at the end of the 1970s, gradually led us to consider things  differently and to start afresh on new bases to develop a new approach to knowledge representation, or the description of the various implied knowledge elements, and inference mechanisms that could be implemented according to the specifications of the problem, to the context or background surrounding a decision, and also the ultimate purpose of the decision. The application of fuzzy set theory to medical decision-making was being carried out by a group headed by Elie Sanchez within our laboratory. We worked on these fuzzy knowledge representation models and on the decision rules being used. This gave birth to the SPHINX project that led to my PhD dissertation on the subject. My completion of the PhD in 1983 was followed by a stay at the MIT upon the courteous invitation of Professor Peter Szolovits. I treasure the memory I have of the people I was lucky enough to meet at that time and of the fruitful rewarding exchanges that followed. The SPHINX shell for expert-systems was used both in the application of diagnosis support for epigastric pains and icterus as well as in designing a therapeutic aid for non- insulin dependent diabetes. This project entailed much research and a close partnership with Michel Joubert. This working relationship lasted until the end of our respective professional careers. The application of the SPHINX system in diabetes was successfully evaluated for current practices by two scores of GPs from the Provence area, thanks to the Minitel terminals,which were used quite a lot in France during the pre-Internet era. The European community and particularly the French one, was very active and expert systems projects in medicine were many. This momentum enabled us to launch, in Europe, the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine Society with Mario Stefanelli from Pavia and John Fox from London. The first congress of AIME was organized and took place in Marseilles in 1987. The results of our research made us increasingly enthusiastic about the applications we had implemented as we kept improving the efficiency of the technology. Most of the time, these achievements aimed at showing evidence to prove that the model was valid and gave satisfactory results. This approach centered on efficiency and performance caused confusion because it led people to think that the efficient running of the systems entailed acceptance by the practitioners. We came to realize that the reality was altogether different. As a consequence, our projects had to evolve towards a broader vision of the information processing in order to make it possible for the applications helping decision making to be integrate into the workflow of professionals, so as to prove themselves useful and usable. So we gradually headed for a more systematic vision. The target was moving and the theoretical approaches to modeling the decision processes were seen as becoming less important, while the rapid advances in technology were becoming more important. Further developments happened in 1984 at the very same time that new challenges were awaiting me. First, I was appointed a Professor of Medical Informatics, and then in 1986 placed in charge of the Medical Information Department in a hospital belonging to the Assistance Publique des H\u00f4pitaux de Marseille. We were led to consider a systematic approach to overall information processing in a hospital mainly inspired by the model that had been set up by Homer Warner and his group at the LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City. This particular approach incorporated the different fields of classical research in medical informatics, such as the description of the medical concepts, ontologies, semantic references, decision rules and reasoning patterns and the cognitive models of human-machine interaction.  The difficulties of representing shareable and reusable knowledge and the semantic inter-operability of the components of the information systems were at the center of our research in order to improve medical decisions using whatever adequate data and knowledge was available. For this purpose we ourselves experimented with the various uses that health information systems can make of the knowledge provided by the UMLS (Unified Medical Language System). In time medical informatics impacted medical care and health practices, gradually playing an active part and contributing significantly to their changes. In 2003, upon request of the French Minister of Health I wrote a report on the implementation at the national level of a shared computerized medical record. It resulted in the lauching of the French Project DMP (Dossier Medical Partag\u00e9 standing for Shared Medical Record) the implementation of which is still in progress today. The requests from the patients to have access to medical information and the need to provide high quality medical care from the relevant professionals on one hand, and the requirements for process control necessary for quality checking on the other hand, have deeply changed the expectations about healthcare from society as a whole. The paradigms of evidence-based medicine and of the patient empowerment have emerged thanks to the improvement in access to information that Internet technology supplied. Thus, early in the first decade of the new century, we were led to approach other new fields of research: a) The inclusion of clinical guidelines within the information systems was our main concern at the end of the 1990\u2019s; b) The development of access to health information following the paradigm of patient empowerment led us to collaborate with the late Jean-Raoul Sherrer and the Health On the Net Foundation (HON) in 2001 on the European WRAPIN project (Worldwide Online Reliable Advice to Patients and INdividuals) that aimed to develop a new approach using a research engine to enable and empower the citizen to judge the information available on the Web; c) Through the European EU-ADR project we investigated the possibilities of reusing the data from clinically heterogeneous data bases, which is one of the most important questions for epidemiology and public health. Paul Avillach, who was at the time my PhD student, made a decisive contribution to the project. Detection of clinical events from diverse and heterogeneous electronic sources of information such as hospital discharge claims, death registries, laboratory tests results, and general practice patient records are very useful for various epidemiological purposes. The EU-ADR project aims to detect adverse drug events from eight databases from four European countries, combining different sources of information. Looking back over the last forty years leads us to assess the fast evolution that has taken place in the medical informatics world. This evolution has involved building, coining terms, and contributing to new concepts, models and paradigms. The results obtained this way can already be seen in day-to-day medical practice. Innovations in numerical methods and computations is far from being the sum total of technical and scientific advances. Informatics tools expand our memory, stimulate our thoughts and bring forth fresh ways of thinking, writing and communicating. Yet, medical informatics contributions to the ever-evolving health systems and medical practices may be direct at times but indirect most of the time. Today, medical informatics joins with e-health, producing new challenges that must be taken up by oour young field of research, already so bountiful and so with so much that is rewarding. In this field we are on the threshold of a brand-new history waiting to be written.  John Fox (1948 - 2021) Professor of Cognitive Science and Systems Engineering, Oxford University Chairman, OpenClinical CIC; Chief Scientific Officer, Deontics Ltd From algorithms to cognitive systems: a career in medical AI I was born and raised in Sheffield, a large steel J. Fox, BSc, PhD city in England, to parents with strong practical instincts; my mother Ethn\u00e9 was a nurse, and my father Paul was an immigrant and apprentice in a precision tool company. Paul became an ambulance driver for a period at the beginning of WWII and later a medical radiographer. In the 1950s, he put his skills together\u2014including what we would now call entrepreneurial skills\u2014to form the first \u201cindustrial radiography\u201d company in the UK, which is still in business today. After school I attended Durham University, a smallish student-oriented institution where the scientific study of psychology inspired me, and I took my first course in AI. This led to a PhD in the renowned MRC Applied Psychology Unit in Cambridge (UK) supervised by John Morton, a charismatic and eclectic cognitive psychologist who encouraged my interest in computing and AI. I was also influenced by Donald E. Broadbent, who supported my instinct for combining theoretical and applied work. Their reputations opened doors to a post-doctoral year with cognitive psychology pioneer Ulric Neisser at Cornell University, and with Allen Newell and Herb Simon at CMU in Pittsburgh\u2014not one but two of AI\u2019s founders! While I was in Pittsburgh I started to think about medicine, AI, and robotics, and this led to the opportunity to spend a couple of days at Shadyside Hospital near CMU, where I was made welcome, put into a sterile gown and mask, and allowed to wander almost unsupervised through the hospital\u2019s operating rooms for most of a day. I found myself next to surgeons and their teams, standing on little stools to see better, chatting about AI and medicine, and occasionally being told off for being \u201ctoo close\u201d. My enthusiasm and English accent made me as exotic and interesting to the Shadyside surgeons as they were to me. It surely couldn\u2019t happen today. The next challenge was to get (or as it turned out, invent) a job back in the UK. I wanted to pursue my interest in the psychology of medical thinking and try to use this understanding to develop AI systems to help in clinical work. That wasn\u2019t an easy concept to sell, but in 1975, I was offered a position in a small but innovative human- computer interaction research group where my job was to establish what we would now call a cognitive informatics program. Paul and Ethn\u00e9 never really understood what I did but they liked the medical connection. The program developed on three tracks: (1) \u201crational\u201d decision theory; (2) empirical studies of human decision making (taking medical decision-making as a model), and (3) the design of decision support systems. The idea was to combine concepts from 1 and 2 to provide sound foundations for 3 and validate the approach in practical clinical applications. This program would have been impossible to do alone, but I was very lucky to meet two supportive and experienced colleagues: David Barber, a medical physicist,  and Chandu Bardhan, a senior gastroenterologist. We saw potential value in two contrasting approaches. The first drew on the work of F. T. (\u201cTim\u201d) de Dombal, a surgeon in Leeds who had controversially demonstrated the practical value of probabilistic methods for diagnosis. The second approach came out of AI\u2019s \u201cknowledge- based expert systems\u201d which put the focus on symbolic computation rather than numerical algorithms. The symbolic approach seemed to offer a wider range of capabilities than just decision- making, including complex reasoning and problem solving, visual image interpretation and natural language understanding, planning, and other elements of human expertise and professional practice. Our first decision support system was of the Bayesian kind, a simple probability calculator for the differential diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal pain. This system was initially used to investigate whether statistical methods could significantly improve the training of medical students in simulated diagnostic decisions. The results were unequivocally positive, so the software was adapted for clinical use and trialed in Chandu\u2019s clinic (Fox et al., Int J Biomed Computing 1979; 1981). The FIRST AId project was promising, though we had doubts from a human factors point of view because the algorithm used to calculate the probabilities was a \u201cblack box\u201d that humans would struggle to understand (still an issue 40 years later!). We thought that cognitive methods would be easier to explain and more acceptable to clinicians. Our intention was to repeat the clinical trial but replace the Bayesian system with a symbolic decision model, but this did not happen because the project came to an unexpected halt when our research funder decided to end support for it. (AI was even more controversial then, particularly in medicine.) When one door closes, however, another often opens, and I was recruited by Sir Walter Bodmer, a leading mathematical geneticist, to set up an AI group at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in London (now called Cancer Research UK). The ICRF provided me with the resources to establish an AI program that could address a range of problems in biomedical informatics. Following the development of knowledge-based systems in the US, the European expert systems community grew rapidly. Through the British Computer Society, I met Alex d\u2019Agapeyeff, a well-known entrepreneur who was enthusiastic about expert systems. He saw an opportunity to apply our research in business as well as medicine, and with David Frost, a versatile young psychiatrist who was working on natural language interfaces for medical databases, he funded the creation of a general-purpose development tool called \u201cXi\u201d. Alex\u2019s company Expertech had some commercial success with Xi before market conditions turned against expert systems and the famous next \u201cAI Winter\u201d set in. Expertech was acquired by Inference Corp., one of the first Silicon Valley AI companies. Rule-based systems like Xi have value in simple kinds of decision-making, but they are difficult to use in complex applications like treatment planning or workflow management. The kinds of rules that expert system developers typically created were conceptually simple, semantically shallow, logically restrictive, and the rule bases were difficult to scale. The opportunity to try to find a new solution to these problems came through a project called \u201cThe Oxford System of Medicine\u201d. Oxford University Press (OUP) was, and is, a major medical publisher and a pioneer in electronic publishing. In 1985, they asked Peter Pritchard, a general practitioner and visionary writer on primary care, to advise on whether a new kind of computerized information system could be designed to assist GPs in making a wide range of routine medical decisions. Peter persuaded OUP that expert systems might offer a way forward, and we were asked to build a prototype. The project took about six months, and while it was far from  being a mature product, the Oxford System of Medicine demonstrated a number of ideas that have played a central role in our work ever since (Fox et al., Artif Intell Med 2; 1990). OUP decided not to take the project any further, however, because they decided that there was an insufficient business case for a practical product. The goal of the OSM, like OUP\u2019s traditional flagship publication the Oxford Textbook of Medicine which it was intended to replace, was to cover a large swathe of general medicine, but OUP reckoned that the costs of creating and maintaining a knowledge base on that scale would require an investment that the predicted sales of the product could not justify. The OSM project sought to extend the state of the art in knowledge-based systems and to build on sound scientific and technical foundations. It drew on ideas and methods from cognitive science, AI, and computer science, and in return I believe it contributed to a deeper understanding of human and machine cognition as exemplified by medical thinking and clinical expertise. Subsequent work was funded by a series of European grants which addressed some of the engineering issues raised by the challenges of scale that the OSM concept faced, and some theoretical issues in the design of cognitive agents and in general AI. We built a number of tools based on the cognitive framework while drawing on formal design and software engineering methods. A key result was PROforma, an AI language which formalizes high level concepts like decisions, plans, and argumentation for reasoning logically in the presence of uncertainty. PROforma drew on the clinical insights of a long-term clinical collaborator Jean-Louis Renaud-Salis, Chief of Head and Neck Surgery at the Bordeaux Regional cancer center, France. Jean-Louis\u2019s understanding of complex cancer care and practical clinical processes took us into a far more complex space than pure decision-making, including planning and management of processes of care over time. PROforma was first described at Medical Informatics Europe in 1996 and received th the EFMI 20 Anniversary Gold Medal. In 1999, it led to two start-up companies, a medical records company in Bordeaux, France and InferMed Ltd., a spinout from the Imperial Cancer Research Fund which was made possible by an investment from two business collaborators, Dr. Alan Montgomery and Linda Montgomery; InferMed was acquired by Elsevier in 2018. As well as addressing technical and engineering issues, the InferMed team and others have shown that PROforma is a practical and versatile language for modelling clinical guidelines, care pathways, and other point of care services as executable models of practice (Sutton, Fox, JAMIA 2003). At the time of writing, it has been used to design and implement clinical services in dozens of settings, and to my knowledge more than 15 have been evaluated successfully and reported in mainstream medical and technical journals. One of the important background influences on my work, which has dictated my concerns with good science and sound theory, is that errors in clinical decision-making can so easily lead to patient harm. Psychologists have been arguing for half a century that people are not as good decision-makers as we like to believe, and the evidence that medical error is common is at last widely accepted, if still sometimes reluctantly. The idea that computers can provide cognitive prostheses to help improve clinical decision making is finally getting traction. Yet it surprises me that while we expect clinicians to follow best medical practice as a matter of course, many informaticians have not also adopted best engineering practice as a matter of course! It seems to me that the \u201cduty of care\u201d that we as informaticians owe to our users, both clinicians and their patients, still tends to be ignored. Writing medical software without addressing quality and safety of the design and implementation with established  techniques from computer science and software engineering seems to me both common and a matter for concern; building systems that give advice to humans on safety-critical matters even more so. In Safe and Sound: Artificial intelligence in Hazardous Applications (2000), Subrata Das and I described a range of methods that can be widely adopted in medical informatics and AI, but there seems little sign of this happening. After more than two decades living and working in London, my team and I were offered the opportunity to re-organize our program in a way that would allow us to work in a more interdisciplinary way and translate our research into everyday clinical practice. In collaboration with the Royal Free Hospital (London), Oxford University, and Edinburgh University, we set up COSSAC, a collaboration addressing key challenges in software engineering (Oxford), AI planning and goal-based agents (Edinburgh), and a \u201cclinical incubator\u201d at the Royal Free Hospital in London whose mission was to carry out clinician-led projects. CREDO, our flagship clinical project in cancer, set out to demonstrate practical benefits of cognitive systems in clinical decision making and management of multidisciplinary care across the patient journey, taking breast and colon cancer as examples, and including patient-centered and shared decision-making. Important practical outcomes of the CREDO project were Deontics Ltd. (www.deontics.com), a spinout company whose goal is to take the CREDO technology into commercial use, and OpenClinical (www.openclinical.net), a not-for-profit company focused on publishing models of best practice in the form of executable knowledge, and empowering clinicians and the informatics community to share their expertise (Fox et al., Computers in Industry 2013). Fifty years after starting on a degree in psychology, the pattern of my career is finally clear; in that hackneyed phrase, I am a jack of all trades, master of none. But I have had the great fortune to be mentored by many masters: in psychology and cognitive science; AI and computer science; mathematics, logic, and even some philosophy; and of course, medicine and clinical practice. I am convinced that sustainable success with the problems that face us depends upon secure scientific foundations and not just smart programming (Fox et al., J Biomed Inform 2010; 2017). This stance cost me my job a couple of times, and it took the first half of my career to be confident that the theoretical foundations of our technologies were secure enough to be used safely in patient care, and the other half to accumulate a sufficient body of evidence that cognitive science is a secure base for medical AI. But it has been hugely rewarding, often great fun, and I think that Paul and Ethn\u00e9 would have approved. ", "Francis Roger France": "Professor Emeritus of Medical Informatics and Internal Medicine Past President of the School of Public Health University of Louvain EFMI Honorary Fellow, Past IMIA Vice President Special Advisor to the EEC Vice President When I graduated in medicine in 1967, the day before my wedding with Anne Marie Wouters, I had been selected a few months earlier to be among the five first laureates in the competitive examination for candidates in the specialty of internal medicine. My choice had not been made by chance. Born in 1941, my grandfather, Dieudonn\u00e9 Roger, was a famous surgeon, Lecturer in anatomy at the University of Louvain, and founder of the largest hospital (Jolimont) in the Walloon region during the prosperous period of coalmine production in Belgium. My decision to study medicine was most likely influenced by my father, Charles Roger, Professor of Economics at the University of Antwerp, who admired his father, killed in a car accident in 1942. The family of my mother, Yvonne France counted several innovative \u201cmine engineers\u201d using a lot of mathematics. These three disciplines (medicine, economics, mathematics) were perhaps the genetic roots of my career in health informatics. At the end of my studies in medicine at the University of Louvain (UCL), I decided to work in a field other than surgery that was practiced by two of my uncles, Paul Roger and Andr\u00e9 Marescaux. After a survey of the literature, I decided to orient my clinical practice toward populations, by studying clinical epidemiology. I asked the advice of the Head of the Department of Medicine, Professor Franz Lavenne (1919-1988). He was open to the idea and recommended that I stand as a candidate for the competitive examination that was mandatory to become a \u201cgeneral internist\u201d, the largest branch of medicine, as the best starting point for future epidemiological studies. He also proposed that I discuss the project with the founder of the new School of Public Health of the UCL (1966), Professor Michel Lechat (1927-2014). This physician was a worldwide expert in epidemiology. He studied tropical medicine in Antwerp and wrote his PhD thesis on leprosy at Yale University. His name is associated with Graham Greene, who wrote A Burnt-Out Case (1960) after a stay in the leprosy clinic of Doctor Lechat in the equatorial forest of Lyonda (Belgian Congo). Professor Lechat agreed that I should follow courses in epidemiology during my first years of internship in general internal medicine. A year later, in 1968, Prof. Lavenne came back to inform me of the decision of the University of Louvain to build a new teaching hospital surrounded by the Faculty of Medicine and the School of Public Health in Brussels. He told me that the planning committee was seeking a physician to manage the patient records. \u201cMedical records contain the information needed for clinical epidemiology. An electronic patient record has to be created for the new hospital. It should be unified by the patient, and computerized. You are the only candidate that I see both motivated and trained in this area. If you accept, I will support your candidacy. If you refuse, don\u2019t count on me for anything.\u201d I accepted. As Henry Kissinger once said, \u201cThe absence of alternative clears the mind marvelously.\u201d  I was appointed by the medical Director, Professor Pierre Lacroix, as the head of a new Faculty unit called \u201cCenter for Medical Informatics\u201d, in charge of the computerized patient record, under the leadership of Professor Jean-Jacques Haxhe (1930-2015), the planner and \u201cfounder\u201d of \u201cCliniques Universitaires Saint Luc\u201d in Brussels. Eric Gheur, a mathematician knowledgeable in electronics and informatics, assisted my work. In 1968, there were no microcomputers yet, nor networks or data banks. We worked in COBOL and FORTRAN. Data were punched on Hollerith cards that we carried to the University computer center and we received the results on listings. My research was oriented toward simple ideas, to be strictly applied. I proposed to build the electronic record progressively, by first obtaining a unique identification number for each patient by allowing the assembly of all his/her data over his/her lifetime. This number had to be protected in order to respect patient privacy and medical secrecy. Administrative data (dates of stay, residence, medical specialty, etc.) were added, as well as diagnoses and interventions coded with an international standard (code ICD-9CM). This medical record summary (MRS) could be linked to other data related to the patient, including lab results, billing data, and prescriptions. The MRS could, therefore, be used for clinical research, population-based epidemiology, biostatistics, quality of care, and patient management evaluation, as well as health economics. The model of MRS that we developed at the UCL was extended to all hospitals in Belgium, step by step, and became the basis of discussion for the European \u201cMinimum Basic Data Set\u201d endorsed by the EEC (European Commission) and WHO-Europe (World Health Organization) in 1982. In 1968, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) organized an international course on Medical Informatics (in French), in Toulouse for over a month and a half, full time. Eric Gheur and I attended these lectures, which were exceptional, since most of the leaders of medical applications in France explained how they worked for medical imaging, electrocardiogram interpretation, laboratory computing, biostatistics, nuclear medicine, and other research programs. Toulouse subsequently hosted annual Congresses in Health Informatics, under the direction of Professor Fran\u00e7ois Gr\u00e9my. With applications of the MRS working since 1969, Professors Haxhe and Lavenne proposed that I complete my two last years of training in general internal medicine and begin studying health informatics in the USA. I applied to the Mayo Clinic and to the Health Computer Sciences unit in the Department of Public Health at the University of Minnesota. My candidacy was accepted by Professor Eugene Ackerman (1920-2014), who was teaching Biophysics at the Mayo Clinic and Biometry at the University of Minnesota. He had received specific funds from NIH (National Institutes for Health) in order to teach health computer sciences. Luckily, I obtained Fulbright support, combined with a BAEF (Belgian American Educational Foundation) Fellowship. These allowed me to travel and to live there for one year with my family (Anne Marie and my two sons, Emmanuel and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois). I was supported during the second year as a postgraduate Research Fellow by funds from the Minnesota Coronary Survey. I spent two years (1970-1972) of intensive work in Minnesota, learning biostatistics, health computer sciences, and clinical epidemiology. I also regularly followed the rounds and staff in internal medicine. I am indebted to Professor Leonard Kurland (1921-2001) for his explanation of the functioning aspects of the medical record as well as his top- level, up-to-date clinic. Kurland oversaw the famous \u201cunit medical record\u201d department at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester) and was the first neurologist to have made epidemiological studies on neurologic diseases. I also had the privilege of attending a  summer class in chronic diseases epidemiology under the direction of pioneers Professor Abraham Lilienfeld and his team from Johns Hopkins University. In June 1972, I defended a Master of Sciences thesis in Biometry and Epidemiology at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, presenting results of my research performed under the supervision of Professors I.D. Frantz, La\u00ebl Gatewood, and Henry Blackburn in the Minnesota Coronary Survey. My thesis was entitled \u201cAn evaluation of Serum Lactate Dehydrogenase in a Diet Heart Survey\u201d. I showed that an enzyme (LDH) could reveal the presence of a myocardial infarction if it increased threefold over the test\u2019s norm value, provided the patient didn\u2019t have leukemia. With a proposal for a basic model to develop an electronic record in Belgium and in Europe, added to the solid educational and practical training in the USA, I was ready to return to work in Health Informatics in Brussels. Upon my return, I was asked to teach, as substitute for Professor Haxhe, the first university courses on medical informatics in Belgium in 1972 by Mgr Edouard Massaux, Rector of the University of Louvain. During my stay in the USA, the \u201cNational Council for Scientific Policy\u201d in Belgium had created a Committee in charge of the development of medical informatics. The medical record summary developed in St-Luc was among the top priorities to be extended to all hospitals in the country. I was appointed in 1972 by this Committee as Delegate of Belgium to the \u201cBiomedical Working Group\u201d of the EEC in Luxemburg, chaired by Peter Reichertz, with the mandate to obtain a standard for hospital medical records in all member countries. It took me ten years to achieve this objective. The European Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS) was endorsed by the EEC and WHO-EUR in 1982. I published my Ph.D. thesis that year, entitled \u201cThe electronic medical record summary, indicator of performance and quality of care\u201d. It was full of examples of applications in financial and management issues as well as evaluation methods. It benefited from the reform of the hospital financing system in 1984 by Jean-Luc De Haene, Minister of Health in Belgium. This system is still in use as of 2016, a combination of the DRG (Diagnosis Related Groups) model designed by Bob Fetter and our local, very detailed, billing system. France (PMSI, Fran\u00e7ois Gr\u00e9my), Portugal, the United Kingdom (Peter Lambert), Ireland, Italy, and the Netherlands were among the first to ask me to consult with them as a European expert. Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Poland followed, as well as the USSR. I was also asked to give advice on health data security in Japan (by Kiyomu Ishikawa) and in South Korea. WHO-EUR (through Kirsten Staehr-Johansen) asked me to contribute to the development of quality of care in Europe. I was chosen as an expert in this field by the World Bank for the evaluation of hospital care in Tunisia, in association with all the Maghreb countries. Another aspect of my influence in health informatics was the development of a very structured Problem Oriented Medical Record in St-Luc for my medical practice. It was based on Lawrence Weed\u2019s concepts but modified in order to facilitate the link between patient complaints and diagnostic models. This was made by hand but proved to be very useful in my practice of general internal medicine to provide a holistic view. My patients came from all over the world, and I was invited by heads of state in countries like Ethiopia and Yemen. My patients were trustworthy and made my reputation. In the last years, I was appointed among the 40 special Advisers to the European Commission for patients visits and for recommendations of health services. I was asked to deliver opening speeches on mHealth and eHealth and on their consequences for health professions in Fes (JFIM, Marocco) and New Delhi (APAMI, India) in 2014. ", "Antoine Geissb\u00fchler": "Vice-Rector of the University of Geneva Physician-in-Chief, Division of eHealth and Telemedicine Director, Innovation Center at Geneva University Hospitals President of IMIA (2010 \u2013 2013) When in 1975, at the age of 11, I chose an optional course on \u00ab informatics \u00bb in my high school, I expected to learn about information and journalism. I was obviously wrong but, quickly, was captivated by the riddles of dealing with punched cards on an ICL computer remote job entry. This mistake taught me two important lessons that I have repeatedly confirmed throughout my career: first, that the focus should be information, not computers, and, second, that there is a lot of uncertainty, gamble and surprises in many of our choices. I spent my teenage years playing with several now-forgotten computers, including the visionary first Swiss personal computer, the Z80 processor-based Smaky 6, the Honeywell Bull 1642 and Pr1me minicomputers, and the DEC Pro 350 microcomputer. With a group of like-minded computer nerds, I designed graphical terminal emulators, networked games, as well as an astronomy software which received the First Award at the Philips Young Scientists European Contest in 1981. In 1984, I paused for a year during my medical school studies to work as a software engineer for Digital Equipment Corporation on the French Riviera\u2014where else?\u2014 discovering the power of computer networks and of worldwide collaboration opportunities: DECnet was, at the time, the largest computer network. I finished my medical school at Geneva University, working in parallel to develop three-dimensional reconstruction software for a new positron-emission tomography camera designed by CERN and the Geneva University Hospitals. Highlights of this period included the opportunity to test new reconstruction algorithms on the now- mythical, liquid-cooled, smoothly vibrating, bright yellow and blue Cray-XMP computer in the imposing computer center of CERN, the Geneva- based Nuclear Research facility, to collaborate with future Nobel Prize winner Georges Charpak, and to run these reconstruction algorithms at the Hammersmith Hospital MRC Cyclotron Unit in London, for ground-breaking neuroscience research projects. As a freshly graduated physician, I spent several months working in the slums of Calcutta with Dr. Jack Preger, A. Geissb\u00fchler, D. Detmer, R. Haux, A. Margolis, W. Hirsh, MEDINFO 2015, S\u00e3o Paulo  discovering realities of a world that I had been mostly shielded from until then. I had planned to train as a pediatrician but was instead recruited\u2014an offer that could not be refused\u2014by Professor Francis Waldvolgel, head of internal medicine at Geneva University Hospitals, who was a visionary about the development of intelligent software for medical decision-support. At that time, Prof. Jean-Raoul Scherrer was deploying the DIOGENE hospital information system, which was being made ready to interact with healthcare professionals. Very much impressed by a book by Peter Szolovits on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine that I had discovered at the MIT library while visiting friends in Boston, I decided to pursue a post-doctoral fellowship in that domain. I asked Jean-Raoul Scherrer\u2019s advice, and joined Dr. Randy Miller\u2019s team in Pittsburgh\u2026two months before he moved to Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), where I followed him, with my wife B\u00e9atrice (just married), giving us a five-year honeymoon in Nashville, TN. My plan was to work on embedding decision-support tools in the CPOE system being deployed there, but it turned out that the tool first needed to be significantly modified in order to be accepted and used by the VUMC doctors. Thanks to the confidence and support of Dr. Bill Stead, we were able to build WizOrder, an innovative CPOE and decision-support system, using an approach similar to today\u2019s \u201cdesign thinking\u201d method. The recipe for success: we spent 20,000 USD per year on pizza to get the participation, advice, and buy-in from busy but always hungry residents and nurses. Returning to Geneva in 1999, I was appointed director of the division of medical informatics at Geneva University Hospitals and professor of medicine at Geneva University. My main mission was to develop and deploy the clinical information system in this 2000-bed consortium of 8 hospitals, and was lucky to be able to do this in tandem with my classmate, Professor Christian Lovis. This mission was accomplished, and in 2010, I set up the division of eHealth and telemedicine in order to refocus my activities on two other projects. These two projects, MonDossierMedical.ch and RAFT were designed in 2000, thanks to the vision of our then Minister of Health and Social Services, Guy-Olivier Segond, who had understood early-on the key role of information and communication technologies in health and healthcare. MonDossierMedical.ch (MyMedicalRecord) aimed to better connect the various stakeholders of the Geneva healthcare system, specifically through a patient-controlled, distributed, federated, electronic health record, so as to provide various coordination-of- care services. This project required further push in order to scale-up so as to serve the population of Geneva and expand to Switzerland, and enable its use in the rapidly growing domain of digital medicine. In the same vision of enabling patients to better participate in their healthcare, Guy-Olivier Segond and Jean-Raoul Scherrer set up, in 1996, the Health-On-the-Net Foundation, which I have been chairing since the passing of Jean-Raoul Scherrer in 2002. Telemedicine can also provide tools and services to strengthen health systems globally. Geneva is home to the many health- and technology-related international organizations, and to dozens of NGOs involved in global health. The State of Geneva has supported me, since 2000, in the development of a large telemedicine network, the RAFT network, first in French-speaking Africa, and now in 25 countries and in five languages (French, English, Spanish, Portuguese and Russian), connecting hundreds of hospitals and thousands of care professionals, and providing South-South tele-expertise services and continuing distance education sessions. This work led to the creation, in 2005 of a WHO Collaborating Center for eHealth, which I also direct.  The focus of our research shifted accordingly, from hospital information systems and clinical decision-support systems to larger eHealth systems implementation research and evaluation of their actual impact on health outcomes. Our lab\u2019s name exemplifies it: the HI5 lab, Health Informatics for Innovation, Integration, Implementation and Impact. These international collaborations also motivated my engagement in IMIA, an inspiring organization that I had the honor of presiding over from 2010 to 2013. I remain the IMIA-WHO liaison officer and was recently appointed as co-chair of the United Nations\u2019 Committee for Peaceful Use of Outer Space (COPUOS) expert group on space and global health, and as vice-dean for humanitarian and international medicine at the faculty of medicine of Geneva University. In parallel, I have been asked to lead the Geneva University Hospitals\u2019 strategic and cultural transformation plan, engaging our 12,000 collaborators in the redesign of our work processes towards a more patient-centric approach, and towards participatory, innovation-driven, continuing quality improvement processes. Driven by strong humanist values, it is about reclaiming time for quality patient-provider interaction, unleashing, supporting and deploying innovative ideas from all collaborators, and, ultimately, bringing down hospital walls so that the best possible care is provided to our patients in the best possible setting, particularly in their homes. After spending almost three decades embedding information- and knowledge- enabled systems into healthcare processes, sometimes at the cost of stealing the attention of care professionals away from their patients, I now get the opportunity to rethink these approaches and implement new ones, as part of a more fundamental mandate to reinstate human values at the core of healthcare processes. Unsurprisingly, these new approaches do still necessitate, maybe more than ever, clever, innovative biomedical informatics tools. In times of accelerating technological change, it is somewhat comforting that our discipline is being recognized as contributing to adding a bit more of humanity in the health and healthcare of our society.

Haux ", "G\u00fcnther Gell": "Professor and Head, Department of Medical Informatics, Dean, Doctoral Students, Medical University of Graz, Austria Treasurer and Honorary Fellow of EFMI After the study of theoretical physics where my thesis already included computer programming for the numerical solution of physical problems, my first job was as a research assistant for computer science at the Department of Applied Mathematics of the University of Graz (1968). In 1970, the (few) assistants of our department were assigned the task of evaluating the computing needs of the university (a tit-for-tat for our democratic ideas about user involvement). I was given the medical faculty to cover, and during my interviews I was offered (and accepted) a job as a research assistant at the Department of Radiology (Diagnostic Rad., Nuclear Medicine, Radiotherapy) which was in the process of acquiring a computer (DEC PDP 15) for the analysis of measurement data and the modelling of physiological processes in nuclear medicine (one of the very few places in medicine with genuinely digital data). I shared a common room with the radiologists where everybody met in the morning for changing, for a coffee and a chat. Getting to know all the radiologists and their interests and problems led me to tackle additional tasks (in nuclear medicine) where I felt the computer would be most useful: the calculation of dose distributions in the planning of radiotherapy and the documentation of radiological findings for scientific purposes. In the following I try to relate in an anecdotical way my evolving understanding of computer applications in medicine: they are rarely simple tools for a single, well--defined purpose. Often they have the potential to change the medical processes, to produce unexpected side effects, to be used in unintended ways and for unplanned purposes. The responsibility for a system must encompass the careful analysis and monitoring of all potential effects (including disaster management). Early Experiences. It turned out that my real interest was in the application not in the theory of informatics\u2014I did not consider a project to be successful unless the results were really used routinely in the clinic. I remember a report from the late sixties by two people from IBM in Germany about their reconnaissance mission in the US. They describe what we would call a fully integrated electronic patient file, shared between hospitals and doctors in private practice, supported by computer assisted diagnosis and therapy. They conclude with the following remark: \u2018this seems to be a glimpse in the future, but there are many places in the United States where this is just daily routine.\u2019 The remark highlights features of MI at this time: the potential of computers for medicine was seen very early and led to concepts and visions and even some prototypes long before the technology was ready for \u2018real life\u2019 integrated clinical applications. It was easy to publish a paper in this new field but the results (in particular concerning clinical use) were often overstated (to put it mildly). Responsibility. Developing, introducing and running (nontrivial) MI systems is a very responsible and complex task that needs professional dedication and a professional environment. A few anecdotes to highlight my early experiences: I was chatting with a physician from radiotherapy. A patient passes by, greeting brightly. The doctor remarks: \u2018By the way, G\u00fcnther, this guy  probably owes his life to your program\u2019 (Wow, that was motivating! MI really matters!). After a long time of successful use, a physician complained that suddenly the results of a program to determine kidney functions were apparently faulty. It turned out that the radiographers had started to misuse a manual correction facility (intended to correct small transmission errors) to hide away movements of the patient to avoid a repetition of the examination (lesson: one must monitor operation, features can be used in unexpected ways and for unintended purposes). Sitting at home at dinner with my family suddenly a neurosurgeon calls: \u2018We have a case of acute cerebrovascular trauma. The computer is down, tell me - should I proceed surgically or conservatively?\u2019 Background: there was a prospective study and I had written a program to assign the patients randomly to the two groups while maintaining some homogeneity. (Although the answer \u2018flip a coin\u2019 would have been correct, this incident reminded me brutally that this program made a decision that might mean life or death for a patient and that the users did not understand the rationale of the program). These and other experiences led me to the conviction that the responsibility of the medical informatician goes far beyond the usual: ensure a technical state of the art solution according to specifications of the customer, who has the full responsibility for the use of the product. Already in the planning phase one has to consider not only the intended use of the system and its possible side effects, but also possible kinds of misuse and worst-case scenarios. In addition, there must be a professional environment for reliable operation of the system assuring data protection (against unauthorized access), data security (against loss of data), availability, and so on. Over the years, my one-man shop in radiology developed into a clinical center (and later department) for medical informatics. The scientific documentation of a few selected examinations with off-line data acquisition (retyping of the summaries of the reports) became a full departmental information system covering all aspects of the operation of the departments (radiology and pathology), from patient admission to billing, from online reporting to scientific evaluations. After the introduction of digital radiologic examinations (CT, MRI, digital radiology), a PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) was developed in co-operation with industry (Siemens). The system has been expanded to all state hospitals of Styria. Finally, when the hospital organization of the state of Styria decided to implement a HIS, the departmental systems were integrated into the HIS and partially replaced by the HIS. Each of the steps depended on the availability of the necessary hardware and software (our early documentations needed some megabytes of storage; with PACS we are in the high terabytes. The first PDP 15 had two Teletypes as input; now we support hundreds of terminals). We had an internal rule: if our storage capacity is sufficient for the data volume generated in one or two years by a new project, we will start the project and rely on the technological development. We were never disappointed. MI is not technology driven\u2014we know, what we want to achieve\u2014but technology enabled. The successful development and operation of MI-systems by scientists in universities creates a demand by the health community that is satisfied by industry. We take radiotherapy planning as an example: before computerized planning one used standard treatment plans for standard situations. For non-standard situations the planning was more or less an educated guess (except for big institutions with radiation physicists who could simulate the situation with phantoms). When computerized planning became available (our system was based on a model from the Dutch radiation physicist J. van de Geijn) it became really possible to take into account the individual situation (anatomy, location and size of the tumor etc., \u2018individualized care\u2019 avant la lettre). As a  consequence, new radiotherapy equipment like linear accelerators could not be sold anymore without providing also (directly or through third parties) a computerized therapy planning system. One could argue that the ultimate proof of the success of (the concept of) a clinical MI system is the adoption by the (health) industry. There is a paradoxical side effect: after some time, these products are taken for granted and may be forgotten when evaluating the impact of MI on health care! As mentioned earlier, MI may have (unintended) negative effects on patients. One example is the illegal use of patient data\u2014a problem that became increasingly urgent with the complexity and scope of medical information systems (in the beginning locking the computer room when I left my work seemed sufficient). We processed the retrieval requests of the physicians and the rule was, that every radiologist could use all the data for research (the system had a comfortable retrieval interface intended to be used by the radiologists themselves; but they preferred to ask our service personnel and we did not press them: it was much better for our standing if retrieval was done by our staff and not just by the computer). One day an operator alerted me that a radiologist wanted a listing of the examinations of another radiologist. It turned out that both had applied for the same leading position in a hospital. We denied the request and changed the rules: searches for personnel were forbidden unless there was an accepted reason. In a way this was the tip of the iceberg. We began to understand, that a medical information system is not only about patients but also contains a wealth of data about health personnel\u2014and those also have the right of data protection. We drafted rules within the hospital and its organisation. There was a marked difference between the officers with a legal background and me. Their goal was to define clearly (and in legal terms) what was forbidden; my goal was to educate and motivate and to explain why data protection was so important. People knew and respected that selling patient data to insurance agents would be criminal; but they considered it a kind of service to inform relatives, friends, neighbours, in fact everybody who showed affectionate interest about the patient. The ministry of health created a group (STRING committee) with MI researchers from the universities, physicians, public officers etc. to produce guidelines and recommendations for MI. STRING gave recommendations for communication of medical data, for the establishment of a lifelong health record (termed ELGA and now in implementation). One interesting task was the discussion of data protection laws. The members from the universities tried to get a clause in the law to permit linking of personal data for medical research. We encountered resistance from the members with legal background: their paradigm of research with personal data was contemporary history, where the results are definitely about an identified person; when we could explain, that although medical research works with identifiable patient data the results are about causes and therapies of diseases and a patient will never be identified in a publication we were able then to reach an agreement that allowed special provisions for medical research. The potential of MI for decision support continues despite being still work in progress. I still hope that linguistic programs that understand the grammar of natural language and the semantics of medicine will appear and allow for the analysis and reliable indexing of medical texts (an argument I used 40 years ago to defend the use of natural language in medical documentation). New developments will open new possibilities that should be explored and exploited, keeping in mind the responsibility towards patients and society. MI systems must be carefully monitored and evaluated to detect possible misuses or degradations but also inventive and useful new uses.  Looking back, I had to compete for all kind of resources within the department and therefore I had to deliver services that addressed the real needs of radiologists, radiographers, typists, and management. We learned that real needs do not always coincide with needs defined when one plans a system. If one asks a doctor what he expects from a scientific documentation one usually gets the answer: a precise classification of findings that allows easy retrieval with high recall and high precision. We tried to implement such an automatic classification, which needed cooperation from radiologists to maintain and update the thesaurus. This update requirement almost killed the system and finally we settled on pure natural text processing. This was a win-win situation. Radiologists dictated their reports as usual, typists wrote on comfortable electronic screens with superior correction and formatting capabilities and almost noiseless operation. Reports were stored on the computer and could be retrieved by patient name, procedure type and by a search for words in the text of the reports. And science? Doctors were happy with the simple text search for words (not predefined keywords). As I learned, in radiology research means almost always going back to the original images, to reanalyse them with respect to the actual hypothesis. So the patient record is used as a kind of index to the images and for that our users were happy with simple text search. Going back to the original data in the full patient record is not restricted to radiology but seems to be fairly common. The temptation to use only classifications for recording patient data must be resisted: classification puts patients into boxes and disregards individual differences; this is necessary for statistical analysis but can be dangerous for care and sometimes for science. An Ethical Problem: Together with neurosurgery we developed a program for prognosis that found a combination of values predicting lethal outcomes, based on statistics of a limited group. But, could we exclude the possibility that a prognosis of lethal outcome became a self-fulfilling prophecy? After discussion that it might be useful for triage in the case of a catastrophe, we decided to stop this project. Some time later a student who had been at my lecture about side effects and ethics told me he had been offered a thesis project to determine the legal point of death (brain death) automatically. (This is the point when it becomes possible to use the patient as a donor for organs). Of course, this has to be certified by two physicians, but a program might shorten the time between the objective time of legal death and the start of the proceedings. Finally, one could argue, that the automatic detection of legal death was so precise, that the certification by physicians could be omitted. It is highly unlikely parliament would follow this argument but the last thing I (and any colleague) would wish is a phone call of the type: the computer is down; can we start removing the heart? ", "Hakan K. G\u00fclkesen": "President, Turkish Medical Informatics Association (2012-2014) IMIA Representative Turkish Medical Informatics Association In 1997, when I was a resident in pathology, our reports were being written by computers, but the computers were H.K. G\u00fclkesen, MD, PhD being used as typewriters. We were doing retrospective studies by searching for the diagnoses one by one, by \u201cconventional scanning by the human eye\u201d. I felt a need to classify the pathological diagnoses by searching for them with computers, and I asked the head of the department if she was aware of such a system. She went to her room, and came back with an old and dusty book named \u201cSNOP\u201d, which was printed in the 1960\u2019s. She said she had seen it and bought it a long time ago, but she did not know whether anybody was using it. It was the first years of Internet and in a few hours, I learned that the system had evolved into SNOMED. In the following months, I learned more about health information standards and found out about a discipline called \u201cMedical Informatics\u201d. I was very impressed by this new and promising discipline. There was only one program ion the subject in Turkey at that time, it was a master program, and luckily it was in my city, Antalya. After becoming a specialist in pathology, I decided to do medical informatics as a hobby and I started my medical informatics master program in 2000, as a student of Professor Dr. Osman Saka. In a few months, I realized that medical informatics is too deep to be interested in it only as a hobby, so decided to become a full- time medical informatician. I started to work with Dr. Saka in 2001. We worked in the same department until 2013, first, as his student and after that, as his colleague. He was always my primary teacher and my thesis advisor for the M.Sc. and Ph.D. studies. I learned a lot from Dr. Mehmet Yard\u0131msever, Prof. Dr. Nazife Baykal, Prof. Dr. Kemal B\u0131\u00e7akc\u0131, and Prof. Dr. Ergun Karaa\u011fao\u011flu during my postgraduate education. Additionally, Prof. Dr. B\u00fclent Celasun, Dr. Tayfun En\u00fcnl\u00fc, Dr. Ergin Soysal, and Erdal Muso\u011flu have always inspired me with their deep knowledge and vision of biomedical informatics. My first research interest was cancer information systems, and my Master\u2019s thesis was on that subject. During this Master thesis work, I visited Heidelberg University\u2019s Medical Informatics Department as a guest researcher for three months. In 2003, there was no PhD program in Turkey and I was considering doing my Ph.D. abroad. In the summer of 2003, the Middle East Technical University in Ankara established the first medical informatics PhD program in Turkey and I enrolled in this program. I received my PhD in 2009, as the first medical informatics PhD graduate of Turkey. My thesis title was \u201cA patient-oriented decision support framework and its application to biopsy decision for prostatic carcinoma\u201d. I have been working in Akdeniz University School of Medicine, Antalya as a lecturer and researcher since 2005. We established the Akdeniz University Medical Informatics Program in 2006. It was a difficult period, because we had to prepare several hours of new lecture content every week, and we had problems in conducting research  because of limited medical data in Turkey. Some of our earliest PhD students did their thesis research in USA Universities. My research interests include mobile health applications, distant education, serious games, and decision support systems. I also teach \u201cbody and mind medicine\u201d (tai chi, qigong, meditation) as an elective lecture in the medical school curriculum. Starting in 2000, I have been part of the Turkish Medical Informatics Association in every position, including being president from 2012 to 2014. I was secretary or chair of more than 10 medical informatics conferences. I worked as part of various committees of the Turkish Medical Specialist Associations Coordination Platform, Turkish Surgical Association, and Turkish Pathology Associations Confederation as a biomedical informatics expert. During my professional life in biomedical informatics, I tried to be one of the pioneers in my country. I witnessed the foundation and development of a discipline up close. With countless speeches, lectures, professional contacts, and organization of meetings, I believe that our efforts have not disappeared into empty space. At the beginning, there were hospitals without computers in my country. Nowadays, applications such as electronic prescriptions and PACS have become routine. However, I have a disappointment related to the quality and structure of biomedical data. After spending near 20 years in this field, I can say that the main influence on the quality of biomedical data are the healthcare policies of a country. If one focuses mainly on numbers; the number of patient visits, the number of operations, the number of tests, one obtains health records about those numbers, and not on how they relect the quality of care. But, unfortunately, our profession like most others, is always affected by political decisions. R. Haux, with C. A. Kulikowski (R) and K.Takabayashi (L) th at Haux\u2019s 60 Birthday celebration in Braunschweig ", "Reinhold Haux": "Professor, Peter L. Reichertz Institute for Medical Informatics, TU Braunschweig and Hannover Medical School, Germany President of IAHSI and IMIA (2007 \u2013 2010) FACMI, MBWG; Honorary Fellow, IMIA, GBHI Hon. Prof., Univ. of Heidelberg; IMIA Award of Excellence Studies in Medical Informatics at Heidelberg/ Heilbronn (1973 \u2013 1978): It was more or less a fortunate coincidence that I came into the field of medical informatics. After gymnasium I was not sure which subject I should best study. So I first earned some money by delivering parcels for Deutsche Bundespost, Germany\u2019s Federal Post Office. One of my friends told me about a newly established educational program in medical informatics as a joint program of the University of Heidelberg and the University of Applied Sciences of Heilbronn. I was interested in this new program (computer science and mathematics on the one hand and medicine and health care on the other), applied to it, and was accepted as a student. I was influenced by many of my teachers, principally by Professors Herbert Immich, Claus K\u00f6hler and Franz Josef Leven. The medical informatics program at Heidelberg/Heilbronn was likely the program with the most graduates in biomedical and health informatics worldwide, at least during the 1980s and 1990s. Research assistant at the University of Heidelberg (1978 \u2013 1984): My primary task during this time was the designing, conducting and analyzing of data from multicenter observational studies in the context of the priority program \u2018viral hepatitis research\u2019 of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Association, DFG). Professor Herbert Immich, the director of the Institute for Medical Documentation, Statistics and Data Processing has been an exceptional role model for me in order to learn to understand what good scientific practise means. My methodological work was mostly in medical statistics and statistical computing. Persons who had a significant influence on my scientific development as a medical informatician were, besides Herbert Immich, Wilhelm Gaus, Gerd Weckesser, Martin Schumacher, and Norbert Victor. During the last months of this phase I also met with Jochen M\u00f6hr, who had been appointed as Associate Professor at the University of Heidelberg. The discussions with him helped me better understand recent developments in medical informatics. Furthermore he explained me the important work of his mentor and teacher, Professor Peter L. Reichertz. It was also during this time where I had the chance to meet with Peter Reichertz face-to- face. My Ph.D. Thesis was on the use of complex data structures in statistical analysis systems. Reviewers were Professors Wilhelm Gaus and Herbert Immich. Research assistant at RWTH Aachen (1984 - 1987): In 1984 I moved to RWTH Aachen, in the Institute for Medical Statistics and Documentation, directed by Professor Rudolf Repges. He impressed me, among other things, by the strength of his collaborations with clinicians, computer scientists, and mathematicians, and was able to establish cross-disciplinary research teams. Two topics were then of importance in my work: knowledge-based decision support for diagnosis and therapy and hospital information systems. In the first area I have been significantly influenced by Michael M. ", "Richter and Casimir Kulikowski, in the second area by Alfred Winter. My second thesis": "for my postdoctoral lecture qualification ('Habilitation'), which comprised the fields medical informatics and statistics, was on expert systems in medicine. Reviewers of this habilitation thesis were Professors Rudolf Repges, Peter Reichertz and Michael Richter. My first professorship at the University of T\u00fcbingen (1987 - 1989): Immediately after my postdoctoral lecture qualification I was appointed as associate professor of medical informatics (with tenure) at the Medical Faculty of the University of T\u00fcbingen. This position belonged to the Institute of Medical Information Processing, directed by Professor Hans-Konrad Selbmann. He influenced me just as Herbert Immich and Rudolf Repges, had earlier. Let me just highlight one aspect here: He never regarded himself \u2018only\u2019 as medical informatician. For him (as for many others and also for me), there were no crisp borders between different fields dealing with the organization, representation of data, information and knowledge in biomedicine and health care, such as medical statistics / biometry and epidemiology. So, my research continued in these areas. Second professorship at the University of Heidelberg (1989 - 2001): In 1989, I became full professor in the Medical Faculty of the University of Heidelberg. I was director of the corresponding department at the Institute of Medical Biometry and Informatics and, in addition, chaired a second group, which was directly involved in running and further developing the University of Heidelberg Medical Center\u2019s hospital information system. With this professorship I was now also part of the faculty of the medical informatics program at Heidelberg/Heilbronn, where I had been a student before. My research centered on various topics in the areas of hospital information systems and of knowledge-based decision support, publishing several textbooks during this period on hospital information systems, medical documentation, and statistical analysis systems. Also, the Heidelberg/Heilbronn medical informatics program established international relationships in the context of an \u2018International Partnership for Health Informatics Education\u2019, with the international \u2018Frank van Swieten Lectures\u2019 on strategic information management in health information systems as an important course. I was invited to take on new responsibilities in national and international societies, in particular in DFG, GMDS \u2013 the German Association for Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, in GI \u2013 the German Informatics Society, and in IMIA \u2013 the International Association for Medical Informatics. Furthermore, an extensive scientific exchange started between medical informatics researchers in Germany and in Japan. Persons, significantly influencing me in medical informatics during this time, were, at the institute, Elske Ammenwerth, Birgit Brigl, Carl Dujat, Ewald Gl\u00fcck, Peter Haas, Petra Knaup, Florian Leiner, Paul Schm\u00fccker, and Alfred Winter, and, more generally, Hans-J\u00fcrgen Appelrath, Marion Ball, Arie Hasman, Casimir Kulikowski, Franz Josef Leven, John Mantas, Alexa McCray, Jochen M\u00f6hr, Katsuhiko Takabayashi, Willem Jan ter Burg, Gustav Wagner, Jan van Bemmel, and Jana Zv\u00e1rov\u00e1, At the end of this period, in 2001, I had the honour and pleasure of becoming editor of the IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics (until 2007, jointly with Casimir Kulikowski) and of Methods of Information in Medicine (until 2015), starting jointly with Alexa McCray. My third professorship at UMIT in Innsbruck (2001 - 2004): In the late 1990s, I was asked to chair a council to plan the founding of a novel university in Innsbruck, Austria. It was the first-of-its-kind devoted exclusively to the health sciences, medical informatics and technology, and was called UMIT. In 2001 I accepted the offer to move to Innsbruck and to become UMIT\u2019s founding president. As a full professor of UMIT I also chaired its institute for health information systems. In addition to my new duties as president I tried to continue my research activities, as mentioned above. Within  information systems it became more and more clear that there was a shift underway from institution-centered health care (mostly hospitals) to patient-centered care across health care institutions, with a corresponding shift from hospital information systems to more general and distributed health information systems. My fourth professorship at the University of Braunschweig (since 2004): In 2003 I was asked whether I would be interested to become full professor of medical informatics at TU Braunschweig, one of the prestigious German institutes of technology. As it became meanwhile clear that I had to decide between either focussing on science management (at UMIT) or on research and education (at TU Braunschweig), and that I was in the long term not able do both, I finally decided to move to Braunschweig and to join the University\u2019s computer science department. There I became director of the University\u2019s Institute for Medical Informatics. In order to create a regional cluster of excellence in the field of medical informatics, in 2007 I helped found the Peter L. Reichertz Institute for Medical Informatics (PLRI) as a joint institute between TU Braunschweig and the Hannover Medical School (MHH), where I became its director. During this period, I also became President of IMIA from 2007 to 2010. My research now concentrated on health-enabling technologies and on health information systems and management, collaborating intensivelly with Marco Eichelberg, Andreas Hein, Michael Marschollek, Maik Plischke, and Klaus-Hendrik Wolf (health-enabling technologies), as well as by Elske Ammenwerth, Carl Dujat, Paul Schm\u00fccker, Christoph Seidel, and Alfred Winter (health information systems and management) Lessons learned (there are many!)\u2026and further information on how I got into the field and about what I tried to contribute can be found in Haux R. \u201cWer waren Deine wichtigsten Lehrer?\u201d [\u201cWho were your most important teachers?\u201d] in GMS Med Inform Biom Epidemiol. 2013; 9(3): Doc15. (in German - open access), of which this personal story is a shortened excerpt. A detailed personal view on medical informatics as a scientific discipline is documented in Haux R. \u201cMedical Informatics: Past, Present, Future.\u201d Int J Med Inform. 2010; 49: 599-610; and on determining factors for good research in this field, with additional lessons learned, in Haux R. \u201cOn Determining Factors for Good Research in Biomedical and Health Informatics.\u201d Yearbook Med Inform. 2010; 9, 255- 64 (open access). R. Haux and K.C. Lun at UMIT, Innsbruck ", "Arie Hasman": "Vice-President of IMIA (2010-2014) Professor, University of Amsterdam (2005 - 2010) Professor, Maastricht Univ. (1985 \u2013 2005) Associate Professor, Free University, Amsterdam (1974 \u2013 1985) During my PhD research at the Technical University in Delft, I investigated the movements of atoms in a liquid and compared them with the movements of the atoms in a gas. To this end I measured the time of flight of pulses of neutrons starting from their origin (a rotating crystal that produced pulses of mono-energetic neutrons) to the detectors located at the same distance around the sample-holder filled with gaseous or liquid argon. The neutrons were scattered by the argon atoms and the velocity of the neutrons changed, causing differences in flight time. Each detector produced a spectrum consisting of the distribution of the flight times of the neutrons. These spectra were the Fourier transform of a function describing the relative positions of the argon atoms as a function of time. I was probably one of the first investigators in the Netherlands who used the Fast Fourier Transform, introduced by Cooley and Tukey. So my first experiences with signal processing and computing using a large mainframe started early. After I obtained my PhD, I applied for the position of radiation physicist at the department of Radiotherapy and Nuclear Medicine at the St. Radboud hospital in Nijmegen and got the job. Just before I started in Nijmegen, a gamma-camera had been installed connected to a PDP 8E computer (12-bit words, 16K of memory). It produced 100x100 pixel images of the distribution of radiopharmaceuticals in a specified region of anatomical interest. The radioactive isotope technetium-99m bound to a chemical carrier was often used to study the functioning of body organs or to detect tumors. For example, in the case of liver tumors, the radiopharmaceuticals were not absorbed in the Kupfer cells and therefore a cold spot would appear in the liver image as evidence of the presence of the tumor. I had to extend the program to make dynamic studies in a region of interest possible. During this period, I learned about the roles played by the various components of the computer, and how to program in assembler language. I also learned a lot about medicine. In addition, I was involved in radiotherapy planning. In 1973, Hounsfield demonstrated the principles of CT during a radiology conference in Madrid. I became directly interested in its application for radiotherapy planning. Jan van Bemmel at about the same time started the department of Medical Informatics in Amsterdam in 1973. I could join his department, but it took me some time to decide because of the new research possibilities that CT was offering for radiotherapy. Finally, I decided that the new discipline of medical informatics would offer me more challenges and I went to Amsterdam. I\u2019ve never regretted my decision. Working in Amsterdam. I was the first to join Jan van Bemmel\u2019s department in 1974. Not long afterwards my colleagues Frits Schutte and Edzard Gelsema joined. In this period a radiotherapist from Nijmegen, Karim, came to the Radiotherapy department of the Medical Faculty of the Free University. He investigated the outcome of  radiotherapy treatment on larynx cancer. He needed a system to enter, store, and retrieve data, that would in addition construct histograms and cross-tabulations of the attribute values. Together with programmer Thiel Chang, we developed a database management system, called ADAMO (A DAta Management system for Oncology). It included a data definition language and a query language that could be easily used by physicians. Our system in certain ways was rather similar to the dBASE system developed later. ADAMO was also used by colleagues in a few other universities. When I went to Maastricht, I realized that home-grown database management systems were not the future. dBASE was already very successful. So in Maastricht, we used commercial database management systems to support research. But I learned a lot from my experiences designing ADAMO and using it for medical research. During my stay in Amsterdam, I co-supervised a number of PhD candidates. One of the first PhD candidates was Ben Janssen. He studied at the University of Twente and came to our department to do research for his master\u2019s thesis. He then became a PhD candidate. His research project was to develop a method for segmenting and classifying EEGs of sleeping subjects. Because of the non-stationary character of the EEG, it was treated as a series of consecutive short segments (in his case of 1.28s duration) that can be considered stationary. He developed a generator (an autoregressive or AR model) that produced output similar to that of an EEG in its statistical properties. It was concluded that a fifth order AR model with coefficients determined by a Kalman filter, an EEG sampling frequency of 50 Hz, and a segment length of 1.28 s would represent the EEG segment optimally. All segments were then represented as points in a six-dimensional space (the five coefficients and the variance of the segment). Clusters in this six- dimensional space were found and used to represent elementary patterns with which larger EEG epochs could be classified. He showed that he could use the segmentation and classification method to classify the sleep stage of 30s EEG epochs. Ben Janssen was the first PhD I supervised (together with Jan van Bemmel). I was heavily involved in education for medical informatics, as were all of my colleagues. We designed a joint course in which I developed educational material for the topic of decision support. Part of this courseware was a Bayesian probability computation program. When I was in Maastricht, we further extended the program for use on a PC. This was done together with sister departments in Gent and Freiburg, having obtained joint funding for the departments through the Erasmus programme. In 1985, I left the Free University and became professor of Medical Informatics at the University of Maastricht. While in Amsterdam, I was involved as treasurer for the local organising committee of IMIA\u2019s World Congress or MEDINFO, held there in 1983. Beginning Medical Informatics in Maastricht. The department of Medical Informatics was established in Maastricht in 1984, and I was appointed as professor. Jan Talmon also came to Maastricht and together we set up the department. The majority of the new staff, including Arno Muijtjens, Huibert Tange, Siebren Groothuis, Raymond Smeets, Francois Dupuits and Helma van der Linden obtained their PhDs. In this period, we supervised 24 PhD candidates, including those just mentioned. Titles of the PhD theses included, among others, \u2018The optimal use of diagnostic tests\u2019, \u2018Decision support for clinical laboratory capacity planning\u2019, \u2018The reconstruction of 3-D marker trajectories in measuring heart motion\u2019, and \u2018Diagnostic and therapeutic protocols in medical practice\u2019. The department of Medical Informatics was part of the Medical Faculty and for some time it also belonged to the Health Sciences Faculty (which, as we learned later,  was not really allowed), and therefore we also had colleagues from the Health Sciences Faculty. In both faculties, we taught medical informatics in a problem-based way. During this period, I also lectured in Prague (in the context of the EU-funded EuroMISE project) and participated in an international master\u2019s programme in Athens (in the context of a Socrates project). A number of Health Faculty students from Maastricht obtained a master\u2019s diploma in Athens, and I became an honorary member of the Greek Medical Informatics society. I also received a medal of honor from the University of Pilzn for my contributions to the development of medical informatics in the Czech Republic, and I am an honorary member of the Czech medical society J.E. Purkyne. Working in Maastricht \u2013 and part-time in Eindhoven. From 1991 to 2005, I was also part-time professor at the Technical University in Eindhoven. Here I supervised six PhD candidates. One of them was also a member of the Medical Informatics department in Maastricht: Paul de Clercq. He defended his thesis entitled \u2018Guideline-based Decision support in Medicine\u2019 in Eindhoven. He had developed a guideline decision support system, Gaston, that was used in several hospitals. With the help of this system, guidelines in the domains of intensive care, psychiatry, and general practice were implemented. The decision support system monitored the behaviour of the doctors as laid down in electronic patient records, giving feedback if their procedures did not match those specified in the guideline. Gaston was used by Rianne Bindels as described in her thesis entitled: \u2018To test or not to test? Guideline-based automated feedback on test ordering systems\u2019. Paul\u2019s research work was extended in Maastricht by Agnieszka Berendsen. Her thesis was entitled \u2018Intention-based decision support, A new way of representing and implementing clinical guidelines in a decision support system\u2019. My part-time professorship in Eindhoven led to a number of collaborations between PhD candidates across disciplines in both universities. Paul de Clercq was one of them. Eelco Giele from Eindhoven cooperated with Co de Priester, a radiologist in Maastricht. Eelco wrote the thesis \u2018Computer methods for semi-automatic MR renogram determination\u2019, and Co the thesis \u2018Magnetic Resonance Renography: Optimization and clinical orientation\u2019. A third cooperation was between Berry de Bruijn in Maastricht and Ellen Verheijen in Eindhoven. Their theses were entitled \u2018Automatic classification of pathology reports\u2019 and \u2018Speech technology for medical reporting - Consequences for the correction process\u2019, respectively. Apart from teaching and supervising research I also participated in the European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) and the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA). I was involved in EFMI as member of the Board and as publication officer. I was chairman of the Medical Informatics education working group, which later was chaired by John Mantas, and I became the co-chair. I was chairman of the Scientific Programme Committee of MIE 2000, the EFMI conference held in Hannover, and member of the Scientific Program Committee of MIE 2014 in Istanbul. I was also member of the Education Working Group of IMIA. I participated in the development of the IMIA Recommendations for Medical Informatics education and also contributed to the second version of the Recommendations. I was one of the two chairmen of the Scientific Programme Committee of MEDINFO 2001 held in London. I met a lot of international colleagues, who also became friends. Among many others, these include John Mantas, Rolf Engelbrecht, Bernd Blobel, Pirkko Nyk\u00e4nen, Georges De Moor, Reinhold Haux, Kaz Kulikowski, Patrick Weber, Christian Lovis, and George Mihalas, with whom I am still in contact.  Return to Amsterdam. In 2004, I was approached by the University of Amsterdam with the question of whether I was interested in becoming chair of the Medical Informatics department at the Academic Medical Center. The department ran a Medical Informatics educational programme that was established in 1991. The emphasis in the first years of the department\u2019s existence was on education. But when I was asked to come to Amsterdam, the department was also engaged in a number of research projects. Although I was very happy to work in Maastricht with my team, the fact that Amsterdam had the only major Medical Informatics educational programme in the Netherlands attracted me. In Maastricht, we taught Medical Informatics to students from Medicine and the Health Sciences, but these students usually did not become medical informaticians. The challenge to get involved with students studying one\u2019s own discipline helped convince me to accept the invitation. When I came to Amsterdam, the four-year Medical Informatics programme was being replaced by a bachelor\u2019s and a master\u2019s degree programme. The bachelor\u2019s had been already established, and students were following both the new bachelor\u2019s program and the old programme. I chaired the committee that had to define the contents of the master\u2019s program. The Ministry of Education only accepted master\u2019s programmes of one-year duration. I believed that one year for a master\u2019s programme that included a research project lasting 8 months would be too short. We therefore asked the Ministry for permission to establish a two-year master\u2019s degree programme. This permission was granted and in 2006, the Master\u2019s Programme in Medical Informatics was started. The programme was, and continues to be taught in English, with a number of foreign students entering the programme. When I joined the Department of Medical Informatics in Amsterdam, there were already a number of experienced colleagues working there: Ameen Abu-Hanna, Monique Jaspers, Kitty Jager, Nicolet de Keizer, and Niels Peek. That they were experts also became apparent when I retired in 2010: first Ameen and Monique were appointed as professors, and a few years later Nicolet and Kitty followed suit. Niels moved on to become Reader at the University of Manchester. In Amsterdam, we had quite a number of PhD candidates. I was involved in the supervision of 16 PhD candidates, although the main supervision was usually done by one of the colleagues mentioned above. Titles of PhD theses ranged from \u2018Methods for auditing medical terminological systems\u2019 (Ronald Cornet), \u2018Computerized decision support to improve guideline implementation in cardiac rehabilitation\u2019 (Rick Goud), \u2018Morphology, growth and patterning of the developing heart. Methods and applications\u2019 (Bouke de Boer), \u2018Usability evaluation of healthcare information systems. Comparison of methods and classification of usability problems\u2019 (Reza Khajouei), and \u2018On the quality of diagnostic hospital discharge data for medical practice assessment. An experiment in a pediatric department\u2019 (Hilco Prins). I retired in 2010 but still supervised a number of PhD candidates, remaining active until 2013, when my last PhD candidate defended her thesis. In total I supervised 54 PhD candidates. In 2006, I was elected International Associate Fellow of ACMI, the American College of Medical Informatics. From 2010 to 2014, I was Vice-President of Special Affairs for IMIA, and set up the IMIA Accreditation Procedure for Medical Informatics programmes, chairing five site visits accrediting diverse programmes across the world. At the moment, I am still involved as chair of the Scientific Program Committee of the ICIMTH conference that is now organized annually by John Mantas in Athens. ", "Mira Hercigonja-Szekeres": "Professor of Informatics and Applied Statistics Hrvatsko Zagorje Polytechnic, Krapina, Croatia; Professor of Medical Informatics University of Applied Health Sciences, Zagreb, Croatia, EFMI Executive Officer (2014-2019) I completed primary school and the Classical Gymnasium in Zagreb, graduating in Practical Mathematics and Informatics with the Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb. I started my professional career in 1971 as a teacher of mathematics while studying at the Faculty of Science, because there are never enough teachers of mathematics. After the diploma, I continued teaching mathematics as a high school teacher. Then, suddenly, in 1983 I got an unexpected offer which changed my field of work, and area of interest, let us say, for the rest of my life. I was asked to be managing direction engaged in the production, marketing, and sale of medical equipment. During this period, I got to know Medical Informatics and Medical Statistics. At that time, in the field of medical equipment, the biggest problem was connecting the 1980s computer versions to medical devices that were, of course, only analogue devices. A problem for physicians and nurses was \u2018burn-out\u2019 which could happen when existing healthcare practices were not necessarily or matched nor helped by the equipment. So, one could ask: why do we need computers at all, why digitize the (medical) data, why collect them digitized, and what, after all, does it mean clinically to process these digitized data? The year 1987 proved to be another milestone in my professional life: I began to deal with (medical) data and their processing, and soon I became co-owner of the medical equipment company. At the same time, new approaches and many new opportunities were opened up to me when I enrolled in postgraduate studies in Medical Informatics and Medical Statistics at the University of Zagreb Medical School. The beginning of the 1990s were unexpectedly difficult times in Croatia, due to the regional conflicts, so it was hard to find new opportunities, changes, improvements, or new challenges in my existing professional fields. However, in 1996 I was finally able to complete a M.Sc. degree, and in 2010 a Ph.D. degree in Biomedicine at the School of Medicine, University of Zagreb. After 1997, along with continuing to work in the medical equipment business, I started lecturing on Medical/Health Informatics and Medical Statistics. After this time, and with my specialization in the overlapping areas of Informatics, Medical Informatics, and (Medical) Statistics I have been able to engage fully with medical informatics. I mostly stopped my activities in the medical equipment business, and nowadays I use my knowledge and experience to teach college students Informatics, Business and Health/Medicine, and Applied Statistics. I became a member of Croatian Society for Medical Informatics (CroSMI) from its establishment in 1989 and have served as Board member, secretary, and treasurer. I have been the CroSMI representative to EFMI and IMIA (European Federation for Medical Informatics and the International Medical Information Association) and served from 2014 to 2019 as EFMI Executive Officer.  I have held positions as Professor of Informatics and Applied Statistics at Hrvatsko Zagorje Polytechnic, Krapina, Croatia; Professor of Medical Informatics at the University of Applied Health Sciences, Zagreb, Croatia, Assistant Professor in Health Informatics and Statistics in the Department of Biophysics, Medical Statistics and Medical Informatics, Faculty of Medicine, Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Croatia. I have published more than 90 professional and scientific papers, have participated in more than 50 professional conferences, and have been directly involved in the organization of more than 30 conferences on a wide range of topics, mostly related to medical informatics. I did not stop with my life-long education; professional and life experience led me to two areas of expertise: The Statistics of Text Data and Qualitative Analysis. The Statistics of Text Data has repeatedly reminded me of my school education long ago in the Classical Gymnasium (eight years of Latin and six years of Ancient Greek). Qualitative Analysis for medical informatics has, meanwhile, logically followed from the data processing, text analysis, and many other professional experiences. Studies in Health Technology and Informatics, 2009; 150:926-930 ", "Petter Hurlen": "Chair, Department of Radiology, Akershus University Hospital President, Norwegian Society for Health Informatics, Vice Chair Norwegian Medical Association IT Advisory board, IMIA Board Secretary, Chair MIE 2011. My Health Informatics Odyssey My health informatics story is that of a journey rather than that of a career. Like with Odysseus, my journey has taken many unexpected turns. Health care improvement was my Ithaka, the Electronic Patient Record my Troy\u2014and radiology my Kalypso. P. Hurlen, MD, PhD Like most students in the seventies, I wanted to save the world\u2014or at least parts of it. Medicine seemed an obvious choice, and scientific methods the proper approach. Consequently, I started working as a student research fellow in Anatomy at the University of Oslo while attending Medical School. This is where I met my faith. I was given the task of producing 3D images of mossy cells from the dentate area of the hippocampus in guinea pigs\u2014a beautiful cell\u2014 using a Nord 10S computer. I was soon fascinated more by the computer than by the mossy cells and fantasized about how this new technology could revolutionise modern medicine. This was a revolution I wanted to join\u2014it was still the seventies\u2014and so I started Computer Science studies at the University of Oslo in parallel with my Medical studies. At that time, Oslo was one of the Computer Science centres of the world, much to the credit of the Professors Kristen Nygaard and Ole Johan Dahl. They invented Simula, the world\u2019s first Object Oriented programming language, and laid the foundation for modern Computer Science. Dahl and Nygaard were later honoured for their work with the Turing award. Nygaard showed a special interest in people with non-traditional backgrounds, and so I was fortunate to get him as Mentor for my master\u2019s thesis. In this thesis, I made a data model of health care (fairly similar to today\u2019s Archetype models) and discussed the similarities and differences between data modelling and object-oriented modelling. After serving as an intern at Drammen Hospital and receiving my Medical licence, I started working as a consultant at the Directorate of Organisation and Management, where parts of my data model were refined, and published as a National Data Reference Model. However, during this work, I observed that the data modelling tools themselves imposed too many constrains and moved the focus away from what was important and towards what could be easily modelled. To me, it was obvious that the Medical record was the most important information tool for clinicians, and that an electronic medical record could be a significant step towards better clinical decisions, improved collaboration and more efficient clinical work. And so, luck struck again. I was headhunted to the position as Secretary for the National Policy Committee for Electronic Data Processing in Health care, and this position was located at the National Institute of Public Health (NIPH) in Rolf Hansen\u2019s group. Rolf Hansen was a pioneer of European Health Informatics. He was one of the  founding fathers and early Presidents of the European Federation of Medical Informatics (EFMI), he was President of the Norwegian Society for Health informatics, and advisor to the Ministry for Health Informatics issues. His main interests were in the use of IT to support multidisciplinary work, and European research collaboration. Together, we explored the possibility of developing a hospital record system with a focus on clinical needs and clinical collaboration, rather than management needs and reporting, as was the focus of most Hospital Information Systems at the time. As one of very few medical doctors with knowledge and interest in IT, I was asked by the Research council to propose R&D areas for health informatics. I made the Electronic Patient Record (EPR) my top priority\u2014and received funding for a research group to explore the possibility of developing hospital EPRs\u2014to benefit both Norwegian health care and the computer industry. The project was titled Nora (NOrwegian Record Architecture), and did not only explore the options, but developed prototypes in collaboration with the National Hospital, the Norwegian Cancer hospital and Norsk Data (producing Nord computers and software). Our aim was to produce useful results. Research was converted into software, not papers. When it was time to make a real-life installation, the Nora project established a close collaboration with Akershus University Hospital (AHUS), and in particular Professor Jan Erikssen, Chair of the Department of Internal medicine. Professor Erikssen was a visionary in many areas of Clinical medicine, including health IT. One of the challenges in any sort of human communication is to present information in an easily understood way. I had the opportunity to work on this when writing textbooks together my friend and colleague Professor Espen Dietrichs, and medical illustrator Kari Toverud. One of the books \u2013 the Amazing Body \u2013 received the Illustrated Medical Book Award from the Association of Medical Illustrators in San Diego \u201988. This work gave me valuable knowledge that I used directly in designing the user interface and interactions in the Nora project. Good user interfaces are necessary, but not sufficient. I realised that inter-system communication would be a key success factor, and joined the European standardisation initiatives. I was the first head of the Norwegian delegation to the newly established European Standards Organisation (CEN) Technical committee 251 in Health Informatics, and was elected as project leader for the first EPR standardisation effort. This resulted in the European pre-standard prENV12265, which later evolved into standard EN 13606. By that time, I was elected as convenor of the CEN TC215 Working Group on Electronic health records and messaging. Some of the ideas of these standards were inspired by the results of the Nora project. I also realised that scientific collaboration between people with various perspectives, experiences and approaches would make a valuable contribution to our research effort. We consequently participated in the EU Synapses research project, building upon both the Nora experiences and the emerging European standards. After successful deployment of the Nora technology, the time had come to bring the results to market. The choice for industry collaboration was Siemens Nixdorf, and the product branded DocuLive EPR. At that time, I left my position as head of Medical Informatics and Statistics at NIPH to establish my own company, supporting the industrial and scientific evolvement of the DocuLive EPR software. Soon, the software became a market leader in Norway, installed in several Danish hospitals, and on its way out to a wider world through the skilled hands of Siemens Nixdorf. The future looked bright \u2013 not from an economic point of view, as none of the project members had any property rights\u2014but from a health care point of view, since we honestly believed we had  developed software that could improve clinical work. We felt we had conquered Troy\u2014 using wits the way Odysseus did, but without a Trojan horse. However, nothing lasts forever. In 1999, Siemens Nixdorf was split up, and clinical software moved to the Siemens Medical division. Siemens Medical was a successful producer of medical equipment and used the medical equipment perspective to organise software development and deployment. They decided to merge all the different health informatics products inherited from various national Siemens Nixdorf projects into one large project, and also to include software acquired from Shared Medical Systems in the US and Health Care Foundation Classes in India. During the next two years, it became obvious to me that this approach would not succeed, and that DocuLive EPR would never be developed to its full potential. It took Siemens 13 years to reach the same conclusion, but eventually they sold their software and customer portfolio to Cerner. When I made my analysis in 2001, there were no funding opportunities for new projects. The dot-com bubble had just collapsed, all investors and funding had vanished, and I was looking for new opportunities. The solution came to me in a dream\u2014I dreamt that I was working as a doctor at a hospital. And so, I was offered a position as a resident radiologist at AHUS and started a new leg on my journey. In radiology, I had the opportunity to combine my interests in medicine, anatomy and technology. Advanced technology and software is used to depict anatomy in order to identify pathology in clinical diagnostic work. It was exciting\u2014and rewarding. After completing my training as a radiologist, I was appointed chair of the Department of radiology at AHUS and Associate Professor in radiology at the University of Oslo. However, the past has a tendency to catch up with us, and I had little choice but to be involved in the introduction of a Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) at our hospital. I decided to use the opportunity to make an assessment of the introduction process. I applied for funding and made the assessment into a PhD thesis. For the first time, my aim was papers, rather than products. One of the papers from this study received the AHUS scientific award of excellence. Back in the ring, I decided to use more of my time to share my health informatics experiences and facilitate networking. The national and international scientific societies are essential in such efforts. I have been member of the Board of the Norwegian Society for Health Informatics (NorHIT) for 25 years and served on the EFMI council and IMIA general assembly for multiple terms. Together with Professor Anne Moen I successfully applied to host and chair the Medical Informatics Europe (MIE) conference in Oslo in 2011, and the opening session and opening day of the conference took place at AHUS. In 2014 I was elected Secretary to IMIA and member of the IMIA Executive team. My current research interest is the use and re-use of EPR information and tools to extract insight from free-text records, as well as the use of technology to facilitate citizen involvement and empowerment. My perspective is still more directed towards practical results than just scientific merit. AHUS wants to expand its research activities in Health Informatics, and I have been given the challenge to chair this initiative. Health informatics had become my faith, and I had to leave radiology like Odysseys left Kalypso. However, my passion\u2014my Penelope\u2014is music. And\u2014thanks to modern technology\u2014 you can find a clip on YouTube showing a young Petter at the start of his Health Informatics Odyssey, and of the artist singing her second place National Eurovision contribution titled \u201cWhat good is a song\u201d: https://youtu.be/wxloP-xC8zs. ", "Ilias Iakovidis": "Former Director, Telematics Programme, European Commission, Brussels The \u2018calling\u2019 of biomedical engineering and medical informatics As a mathematics PhD student at Texas Tech University (TTU) during the second half of the 1980s, I discussed possible PhD thesis options with my advisor Professor Clyde F. Martin. Two events early in 1988 helped me make that decision, which determined the future direction of my career. The first event was the discovery of a cardiac arrhythmia (atrial flutter) for which I was treated at TTU Health Sciences Centre by Dr. Vasudeva Goli, a young cardiologist. During my treatment Dr Goli asked me for mathematical help with problems he faced in his research. When I brought him answers in a couple days, he was so pleased that we started to collaborate, and I noticed my motivation and excitement growing as I worked on medical problems, while Dr. Goli\u2019s satisfaction increased as results became applicable to his patients. The second event was reading a research paper that Professor Martin dropped on my desk around the same time. It was written by Yoram Rudy and Barbara Messinger- Rapport, biomedical engineers from Case Western who were trying to determine the electrical activity on the surface of the heart (epicardial potentials) from multi-lead electrocardiograms (body surface potentials). This 'inverse problem of electrophysiology' is an example of so-called ill-posed problems to which solutions are very unstable, or very sensitive to noise. I decided to find out what the underlying mathematics of the problem were and how one could obtain meaningful solutions. Despite my supervisor wanting me to eventually work on another problem for my thesis I insisted to take on this 'inverse problem of electrocardiography'. I must have felt the 'calling' of biomedical engineering and medical informatics. Both areas brought three things together: a feeling of contributing to society, the possibility of applying my skills, and, a potential for appreciation by researchers, professionals and people at large. When, after 2 years, I brought my completed work to Professor Martin, he acknowledged that it was one of the best PhD thesis he had seen until then. As a young PhD looking for work in 1990 I received two offers \u2013one was to teach math at a university and the other was as a Postdoc at a biomedical engineering department with the opportunity to try out my theory with real experiments. The 'calling' made it easy and I found myself working with Prof. Ramesh Gulrajani and other biomedical engineers and physicians at the University of Montreal research labs and at the Sacre Coeur hospital, demonstrating that solutions to inverse problems could be found, or stabilised by using constraints from prior knowledge of the problem. Then, as a researcher at McGill University I worked with Dr. Stanley Nattel of the Montreal Heart Institute to develop and run computer models of electrical activity within cardiac cells and muscles. While working in Montreal I had my mind set on returning to Europe, and by chance saw an opening for a scientific officer position with the European Commission (EC). I  applied, interviewed, and received a job offer in 1992 to join the Advanced Informatics in Medicine (AIM) unit, led at the time by Niels Rossing. This unit was financing interdisciplinary, multinational research projects in Medical Informatics (MI) that needed to be tackled on an international level. It was not a position where I would continue as a researcher, so instead became a manager of research activities and initiatives. I took the decision to change my career path over Christmas of 1992 because I saw the potential for fostering international cross-disciplinary cooperation as well as the possibilities of opening new research horizons. In a way I had done the same before within a research setting. Looking back at the past 25 years I realise that I actually did what I set out to do then and have enjoyed this journey very much. From 1993 to 2010, I worked on Contributing to the EU eHealth Research, Innovation and Policy Agenda. I started working for the EC as a research officer managing research projects in MI and medical imaging that were funded by the EC R&D Framework Programme 3 (FP3). In 1994 I worked for one year on preparing the next Framework programme (FP4) working directly with the Director of the Telematics Programme overseeing other areas in addition to health such as transport, education, public administration, the disabled and elderly, etc. This gave me an overview of the role that information and communication technologies (ICT) could play in tackling different challenges and bringing benefits for individuals, society and economy when combined with appropriate organisation, skills, and infrastructure, incentives & business models. At that time, I did not understand yet how this 'broader' experience would influence my thinking and future professional directions. My focus on user-friendly electronic health record systems for continuity of care started in 1995 when Jean-Claude Healy became the new Head of the 'Health Telematics' unit. He provided me with all his support, and the freedom to develop the areas under my responsibility. It gave me the opportunity to bring together the best academics, industry representatives, health professionals and other stakeholders to discuss which topics of MI might best be supported by EC research funds. One of the topics that I have focused on was the development of quality (semantically rich, comprehensive, secure and user friendly) electronic health records as a tool for cooperative and continuous care. I was excited and was absorbing fast the basics of MI through research publications, but more importantly, by talking directly at every opportunity with researchers on my projects such as Jan van Bemmel, Johan van der Lei, Georges De Moor, Werner Ceusters, Alain Rector, Alain Maskens, Jana Zvarova, Reinhold Haux, Otto Rienhoff, Rolf Engebrecht, Arie Hassman, Dipak Kalra, and many many others. One person I would like to mention in particular, who taught me more than medical informatics, was Jean Raoul Scherrer \u2013 a great mentor who inspired his colleagues Antoine Geissbuhler, Christian Lovis as well as many other IMIA members. Coming from North America I also wanted to keep track of what was happening there. In December 1994 we had invited a Canadian delegation to an event organised in Lisbon where I met Dennis Niebergal, CEO of an EHR company and Richard Alvarez who at the time was working at CIHI. Dennis taught me that user needs and requirements are of paramount importance for the uptake and proper use of EHRs. He explained to me that there are 3 priorities: GPs when it came to select EHR systems, and speed, speed and speed. I was also following the developments in the US by cooperating with academics like Andrew Balas and later with Chuck Friedmann when he was at ONCHIT. I had also signed up for the Stanford Summer short course in 1997 \u2013 and found myself invited to teach there for the next few years. The EU\u2013US cooperation led to high level Memorandum of Understanding in eHealth signed by US Secretary of Health Sebelius.  The challenge for me was to guide the R&D that could lead to specifications for an open standards-based architecture of EHR and interoperable EHR systems that in the hands of health professionals (nurses, doctors) would be intuitive, fast to input data, fast to visualise the relevant data, and above all, not to obstruct the process of interacting with their patients. This posed many challenges to computer science and other disciplines. For example, a smart system should be able to take as input speech or free text and dissect it into semantically meaningful structured data. At that time the state-of-the-art market solutions were only able to provide the (less useful) opposite direction: systems with structured data input generating sentences for the discharge letters. The development in EHRs was always seen as a tool to enable not only timely access and cooperative care but also, and more importantly, improved quality and continuous care as well as re-use of EHRs for evidence-based care and patient engagement through secure access to these records. First examples or regional and national health information networks (RHIN) were supported by the EC as early as 1994, for example the COCO project that was led by the Danish Health Information network (MEDCOM). The mid 90's were exciting because there was a hope that work over two decades could lead to wider deployment of MI results in EHRs and decision support systems. I had written my first series of papers on the subject, giving keynotes at EFMI '97, and MEDINFO '98, and teaching MI and EHR short courses at numerous EU and US Universities. At Stanford University I learned of the work of Ted Shortliffe, Mark Musen and Russ Altman. A talk with Russ in 1999 inspired me to venture into biomedical informatics bringing MI together with the bioinformatics and neuroinformatics communities, with the ultimate goal of bridging the ongoing Human Genome Projects results in order to benefit patients. I saw that for that to happen there had to be a new view of the EHR that would accommodate the genotype, phenotype as well as other types of data coming directly from patients (e.g. from wearable, portable systems) and possibly environmental data. I had searched for champions of similar ideas in the EU and met Fernando Martin-Sanchez and Victor Maojo. In 2000 I worked on a preliminary study for developing biomedical informatics communities in Europe and beyond. EHR developments in the EU, however, proved challenging. The health professions community at large was not engaging with EHR efforts for many reasons, including poor usability that resulted in additional burdens rather than helping their daily clinical tasks. I encouraged research projects for improving the involvement of users and development of better Human Computer Interaction (HCI) paradigms \u2013 harking back to the principle of speed of interaction and unobtrusiveness that Dennis had emphasized to me years earlier. I had collaborated with Constantine Stephanidis and Gabriel Salvendy to put together an international community around HCI to look at the specific issues of health care delivery. By the end of 1990s I also enlarged my scope of responsibilities into the so called personal health systems that comprised portable and wearable health systems with micro and nano-based sensors and electronics systems for diagnosis or better management of chronic diseases. Following my natural skills as a bridge builder and synergy promoter I helped bring together biomedical engineering communities with medical informatics communities. This cooperation prospered and many new results led to establishment of a stable field that the EC financed for many years: informatics and personal health systems while EHR systems, telemedicine systems and regional health networks faded away as topics from the research radar. I have led and been a main co-author of the first EU eHealth Action Plan (COM 2004 356) urging countries and all stakeholders to deploy eHealth solutions, including EHRs and RHINs in beneficial ways.  Between 2003 and 2006 I devoted most of my time to foster the development of research in the post-genomic era and its connection with the emerging biomedical informatics community. The EC supported this field with several calls for proposals (RFPS). Projects covered a vast area and it was difficult to see where the EC funds could be focused so as to bring an edge to both basic research as well as bringing innovative systems to market. In 2005 after several road-mapping exercises, we decided to focus on an initiative called the Virtual Physiological Human (VPH) that was inspired by the work of Peter Hunter and Denis Noble. An example involved patient-specific multilevel models of the heart (Virtual Heart), modelling the biological processes at molecular, tissue and organ levels. The goal was integrating the levels so as to avoid pure reductionism and help ba The VPH community and I established close links with Japan and with Grace Peng from the NIH in the US who was coordinating the Interagency Modelling and Analysis Group (IMAG) leading to exchange of views, R&D programs and signing an international agenda in Japan in 2007. In 2010 I was assigned to lead a unit focusing on technologies for the elderly (ICT for independent living) and disabled (assistive technologies). The unit slowly focused on ageing and in particular on supporting research on digital innovation for supporting better cooperation between health professionals and social care workers. This included support for chronic disease management through telehealth, telecare, telepresence, new generation of personal health systems, as well as support for independent living through social robotics, and smart home environments for independent living based on the Internet of things. To conclude, I have witnessed a difference in scope and focus between the MI research community and market forces. Technological developments in this field (eHealth) was driven by market forces that were focused more on managers' and payers\u2019 needs rather than physicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 needs, and that is probably one of the reasons why the use and content of EHR systems (quality clinical data) remain still far from optimal. The immaturity of the eHealth industry is illustrated by their conferences dominated by computer scientists talking for 30 min. on what the future will bring \u2013 if only healthcare practitioners change their ways of working. In contrast, for two established industries (pharmaceutical and medical technologies) one sees health professionals at conferences presenting actual outcomes of using the technologies. ICT and emerging eHealth have become an important constituency in determining the scope of the EC R&D programme as well as those of EFMI, IMIA and other stakeholders from specialised national research agencies. Industry and public authorities are most interested in addressing the gap between research and the uptake of eHealth solutions, leading to pressures on researchers to be more responsive to industrial interests. New innovation type activities started to be funded, such as large scale validation of previous research results. The programmes were called the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP) and have been gradually absorbed into the latest Research & Innovation programme that is called Horizon 2020. The tendency now is to increase the support for innovation, focusing more and more on the deployment of systems and software solutions with direct impact on society. ", "Edward K\u0105cki": "Professor, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Polytechnic University Co-founder, Polish Society of Medical Informatics Past Rector, University of Computer Science and Skills, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a In 1978, I met Joanna Stempczynska, my future wife, who was at the time an oncologist at the Medical University of Lodz. In 1984 she earned her PhD and the position of adjunct professor at the same university. Since the beginning of our acquaintance, we discussed the growing danger of cancer to human life as healthcare costs and related financial problems continued to rise tremendously, affecting all countries world-wide, including Poland. During our discussions, we considered improving the effectiveness of healthcare by utilizing innovations of rapidly developing computer science. As technology continued to develop, we also discussed the possibility of using developing networks and cellular communication. As a result of our thoughts about the use of computer science in medicine, my wife th and I organized in the last quarter of the 20 century discussions and then conferences mainly devoted to using multimedia programming, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence during a time when the development of computer equipment as well as networking were still very primitive compared to today. Over the years, I lectured about artificial intelligence and its uses in the field of Computer Science at the Institute of Computer Science (Technical University of Lodz). Later, I also lectured about the use of computer science in medicine at the University of Computer Sciences and Skills in Lodz. During this time, my wife and I witnessed first- hand the unstoppable development of software and computer science technology. We were able to observe and follow the newest achievements in networking and cellular communication. As a result of my interest in the utilization of computer science to improve the effectiveness of healthcare, in 1988 I co-founded the Polish Society of Medical Informatics (PSMI) in Warsaw. Jerzy Janecki, PhD, DSc and Professor of Medicine, became its first president for a 3-year term. In 1989, my wife and I organized the first conference on \u201cComputers in Medicine\u201d in Poland. In 1990, I was elected the next president of PSMI in recognition of our achievements in the field, and my wife later founded the department of PSMI in Lodz and became its president. While organizing a dozen national and international scientific conferences, \u201cSystems - Modeling - Control,\u201d we organized a section specifically pertaining to computer science in medicine in five of the conferences. Then, with Joanna, I organized two scientific conferences \u201cComputers in Medicine\u201d (1994, 1997) that were solely devoted to computer science in medicine. As a result of these conferences, I became an editor of six volumes of the conference materials published in English. We also organized the international conference \u201cComputers in Medical Activity\u201d (\u0141\u00f3d\u017a 2007), with proceedings co-edited by us and published by Springer Verlag. When cellular phones became ubiquitous for everyday communication , together with various devices that could check vital signs, and linked with the Internet, we  organized two national conferences on Telemedicine in 2000 and 2001. With the Internet, digital telecommunication, cellular networks and satellite connections becoming fairly common for providing medical treatments new opportunities arose for battling cancer at lower cost, and regional networks for Teleoncology sprung up in Poland. During our meetings of the Polish Society of Medical Informatics (PSMI) in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, we led discussions, research and surveys pertaining to the effectiveness and creation of these Teleoncology systems. As a result, we wrote and published the book Tele-Oncological Systems (Warsaw, 2015), containing the following chapters: 1. Cellular Network and Phones, 2. Multimedia, Virtual Reality and Artificial Intelligence, 3. Tele-Medicine, Tele-Oncology, 4. Prophylactics, 5. Diagnostics, 6. Therapy, 7. Tele-psycho-oncology, 8. Rehabilitation, 9. Palliative Care, 10. Medical Education, 11. Scientific Research, 12. Internet and Cellular Phones in Administration, and 13. Teleoncology Systems in Poland and Abroad. As a rector of the University of Computer Science and Skills in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a in 2001, I initiated Computer Science in Medicine as a new field of study, with both my wife and I lecturing students in this new field. We also supervised theses for Masters and Engineering degrees in medical computer science. Among many scientific government programs for which I was a director, those connected with computer science in medicine included \u201cMultimedia, Virtual Reality and Neuronal Networks in Medical Computer Systems\u201d which we implemented (Research Committee Number 8T 11E 02813, 2000). The research centered mainly on diagramming the temperature fields in the body of a cancer-affected patient. My wife and I devoted a lot of attention to the concepts and creation of computer simulators (SIMSs) for medical education (1994 and 2001). When the simulations were programmed and implemented, we tested them in the laboratory with students at the Medical University in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. Educational SIM of a Patient. We designed three consecutive generations of SIMs to educate medical students on how to create a disease history and how to diagnose diseases. The interview of a medical student with a SIM \u201cpatient\u201d became the main element of the Sim system. Every step of the student-led interview with the SIM patient was controlled and assessed by the system. The computer system would randomly choose a disease without letting the medical student know which it was. The interview with the SIM patient relied on question selection and ordering of tests from a list chosen by the system. The answers to the questions given by the SIM were selected from the database of symptoms for the particular disease. The system tracked the quality of questions asked by the medical student as well as the student\u2019s decisions. The system also assessed the quality of the interview with the SIM patient: the accurate diagnosis that included the overall physical exam of the patient while identifying the correct disease. In its first version in 1987-1988, simple programming tools and quite primitive technical equipment were used to program this SIM - Turbo Pascal 5.0 supplemented with additional procedures from the packet Turbo Professional. The second version of the SIM was designed in 1996 using Gupta SQL Windows 4.1 which was a standard relational language, and improved the effectiveness of the program. The second version of the SIM made it possible for students to use the computer medical atlas. The third version of the SIM patient was produced in 1999 with Visual Basic 5.0, and, thanks to the use of WAV and AVI, medical students were able to watch the SIM  patient on the monitor and listen to his or her voice. The development and implementation of the three versions of the SIM patient were presented during meetings of the Polish Society of Medical Informatics (PSMI) and were tested with groups of students at the Medical University of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. Educational Simulator in Radiotherapy. The SIM is a virtual object designed with the virtual reality programming tool WorldToolKit for Windows. Using this tool enables the use of all kinds of interface in virtual reality: connecting with virtual helmets, tracking systems, entering devices with six levels of freedom, surround-sound systems and all the needed graphic accelerators. It works on different platforms, although, many functions contained in this program environment depend on the WorldToolKit Platform (WTK) and contain a rich set of over 400 routines written in the C language. These routines assist in creating 3-D VR applications performing in real time that can work with speeds up to about 60 units per second. As a result, the SIM makes it possible to get a visual picture of the radiotherapy used in cancer treatment and is also able to create scenarios that would have been impossible using the actual radiotherapy equipment. The SIM user has the ability to interactively influence its objects. Seeing the entire radiotherapy equipment and the virtual patient through 3-D goggles, the SIM user can administer radiotherapy by freely manipulating the equipment and changing the position of the patient with the click of a mouse. The simulations described above were presented during many scientific conferences and became pioneers on the Polish market. In conclusion, I have to mention that our mutual work with my wife in computer science in medicine has greatly influenced the organization of work at the Chemotherapy Clinic in Lodz. At that time, one of the first computers was bought for the hospital and part of the medical personnel was trained on it. Maybe not surprisingly, my favorite scientist and unattainable role model is Maria Sklodowska-Curie, the recipient of two Nobel Prizes. ", "Dipak Kalra": "President, The EuroRec Institute for Innovation through Health Data President, The EuroRec Institute for Health Records Clinical Professor of Health Informatics, University College London Visiting Professor, University of Ghent My London general practice founding partners Janet Millar and Meena Krishnamurthy, and many of my patients, taught me how much ethnicity, family situation and poverty can impact illnesses and a person\u2019s capacity to cope with diseases and their treatments. People have very different health expectations and preferences, and a good doctor does not dictate best medical practice, but introduces clinical evidence as part of a balanced and equal conversion about choices with the patient or family, leading to a consensus on what steps to take and what goals to aim for. I realised how essential it was to consider patients holistically, which also means creating and sharing whole person health records, not just the physiological facts. In this deprived inner city practice I learned to cope with high population mobility and refugees from Bangladesh, later Somalia and Ethiopia. Many new patients each month came with no available health records, but with a significant accumulation of neglected health problems. As we began to computerise our practice I recognised that each consultation could not be properly captured with just a few simple codes, and that good health records need to be richer than the systems we had in the early 1990\u2019s. Several local GPs, sponsored by our visionary health authority and working with two gifted software engineers, created a dedicated GP computer system, GP-CARE, targeted at inner city practices. This system and its team flourished in east London for around 15 years. Little did I know that the pathway I had started, towards more clinically relevant and more interoperable electronic health records, would become my future career! In the mid 1990\u2019s I took on leadership of a medical audit group for an east London general practice. I was really surprised at how many general practitioners were keen to use their health data to improve the quality of the care they provided. They used mostly paper records, and some computerised health information, to look at topics like their recording of blood pressures, medicines used in the elderly, and the quality of their diabetes monitoring reviews. GPs and their practice staff were almost universally enthusiastic about conducting audits, comparing their results with other practices, and making changes to improve care. It should not be a surprise that we are finding now that European hospitals are very keen to collaborate in their journey to become better Learning Health Systems. A career in academic health informatics I did not anticipate that these early insights into the importance of holistic and shared decision making with patients, comprehensive computerised health records, the vital need to share these with colleagues to support continuity of care, and the value of learning from health data to improve quality, would become running threads through my professional life.  In 1992 I was invited to join colleagues across Europe to form the clinical reference group within the EC\u2019s first R&D project on electronic health records: the Good European Health Record (GEHR), led by David Ingram. Part way during this I took over clinical leadership, when my GP neighbour Sam Heard emigrated to Australia. We established a high quality clinical requirements blueprint for the EHR, which underpinned my own PhD and later fed into ISO 18303 (Requirements for an Electronic Health Record Architecture). The GEHR architecture, which was inspired by an early EHR innovation by Alain Maskens (Health.One), and formalised under the guidance of David Lloyd and Thomas Beale, has significantly shaped the way in which health data is formally represented by all of the global standards bodies today. GEHR closed by publishing a very strong information model for EHRs, which has been improved over the following 25 years but stayed relatively close to those original concepts. This exciting work enticed me out of general practice and into full-time academic health informatics. Shifting in emphasis from EHR repository models to federated architectures, I participated in the EC projects Synapses and SynEx. In 1996 we developed, and then evolved, the concept of a clinical object dictionary: a formalised representation of clinical models that would complement a generic EHR information model by specifying the hierarchical structure of concepts and value constraints of particular clinical documentation patterns. An inspirational thought leader in developing this idea was Jo Milan, who had fashioned the information systems at the Royal Marsden (cancer) hospital to be fully object-dictionary driven: so we knew this approach could work at scale. We recognised that it was essential to distinguish a stable and domain- independent information model that could be used to design EHR repositories and interfaces, and domain-specific patterns that would not always have a single consensus form per concept, and would need to evolve as medical knowledge evolved. Hence two- level modelling was born, though we did not call it that initially. In the late 1990s we reunited with our former GEHR colleagues from Australia, who had in parallel evolved a similar clinical modelling paradigm on top of the GEHR architecture. We jointly created the openEHR Foundation, into which David Ingram, David Lloyd, Sam Heard, Thomas Beale and I brought together nearly a decade of post- GEHR learning and innovation. One of our unifying crowning jewels was the clinical archetype, which remains today an essential ingredient of semantic interoperability. OpenEHR remains a strong force in the global field of EHR research, design and implementation, and inputs to standardisation. Through it I have been fortunate in making very many warm contacts world wide, and been lucky to have travelled to meet them, learn and give talks, in many countries. It is easy to design beautiful theoretical models, but to be convincing it is vitally important to demonstrate their practical implementability and usefulness. Through Synapses and a long series of subsequent EC projects, I was able to maintain a steady income stream for over 15 years to fund a software development team at University College London (UCL), led by Tony Austin, who would implement successive versions of the EHR architecture, clinical modelling tools, build libraries of clinical models with our local hospital and GP community, and deploy systems into our local hospitals. We worked especially closely with David Patterson at the Whittington Hospital, to develop an innovative anticoagulation management system that would eventually cover a large proportion of north London hospitals and patients taking warfarin. It was satisfying to put theory into practice, and to have a direct impact on the quality and safety of care given to large numbers of patients on this medication, and to have this useful source of learning - about not making informatics solutions any more complex than is strictly  necessary, and of balancing the cost and effort of implementation with the desire to design elegant and future-proof information models. The chronic disease management/advisory system expanded to cover other cardiovascular conditions, and later also involved patients in self-management. This is now operating though a spinoff company, Helicon Health. A parallel career in consensus making In 2003 I was invited by Gunnar Klein and Gerard Freriks, then the Chairman and Working Group I convenor respectively, of CEN TC/251, to lead the development of the EN 13606 standard, with the request to bring into the standards community the work of openEHR, the federated architectures of contemporary European projects and the learning from our implementation work at UCL. I had hoped that developing a standard would be a straightforward matter of inviting inputs and arriving at a consensus on the most suitable level of detail to standardise on. An added opportunity arose part way through this development, of joining with ISO TC/215 to form a common standard, which was positively supported by Don Newsham, the then chair of ISO\u2019s Working Group 1. What I had not bargained on was the complexity of aligning this effort with what was going on in HL7 at the time. HL7\u2019s approach to representing clinical data was less comprehensive then, with no formal approach to the EHR, which made alignment complex to work through as there was no direct correspondence of artefacts to match. Mark Shafarman proved to be a wonderful and supportive guide in finding the best fit, and I was pleased that we could eventually pass (in 2007-8) a joint EN ISO 13660 standard with support from HL7. The revision of this standard, also taking around 4 years, has just been completed in a much smoother and more consensual way. In hindsight, my involvement in the 13606 standard series, twice, in 18308 and in several other standards have shown me - learning mostly through mistakes! - the importance of recognising organisational legacy, of respecting country diversity in missions and priorities, and of striving to discover a multi-way win across stakeholder groups where all can find a pathway of value from an innovation. In parallel to the work on standardisation, in 2005 I was invited by Georges De Moor to join him and EuroRec colleagues in a pioneering project to develop quality criteria for electronic health record systems, Q-Rec. This introduced me to his network across Europe of ProRec Centres and colleagues who had been working in a succession of European projects at the same time as I was carrying out my own work more focused on quality aspects and on working with stakeholders such as the ICT sector and health ministries to promote the adoption of good electronic health record systems and services. Georges had in fact been the founding Chairman of CEN TC/251. Through his encouragement I joined the board of EuroRec, and later took over his role as its President, a post I still hold. EuroRec places itself at the centre of multi-stakeholder alignment challenges and seeks to find consensus pathways to accelerating the adoption of high quality electronic health record systems. I learned a lot from Georges about driving a strong vision, about the values and concerns of different sectors within our field, and the importance of finding solutions that bring value to all of them. Transitioning my career and workplace to gradually bridge UCL and EuroRec, I was involved in many interesting projects focusing mainly on EHR semantic interoperability, privacy protection and anonymisation, with long-standing colleagues like Veli Stroetmann who understood better than I the complexity of the different - sometimes competing - interests in the EHR adoption ecosystems across Europe. Nathan Lea started  as my PhD student, but has now become a peer expert in privacy protection and information governance. Georges and I wrote the EHR4CR proposal mostly sitting in his office over the last three days before the deadline. I know it was a good proposal, but I think neither of us expected the EHR4CR project would bring us into contact with so many smart colleagues from the pharma industry who were motivated to work whole-heartedly in a pre-competitive and open way with academics and with hospitals to create solutions for reusing health data for research that are trustworthy and societally acceptable. The project was led by Mats Sundgren and Andreas Schmidt, from the industry side. It was a great success and I think we will be able to look back on it as introducing a step change in the global attitude and momentum across many stakeholders and countries towards reusing routinely collected health data for clinical research. It has also helped to demonstrate the value of public and private organisations working together on common missions and to overcome common challenges. A new Institute By nice coincidence, two projects closed at about the same time with a wish to create a sustainable, neutral, trustworthy and not-for-profit European body to champion and accelerate value to all stakeholders from health data: for continuity of patient care, for organisational learning and for clinical research. We recognised across the projects, EHR4CR and SemanticHealthNet, that our project endpoints had natural interdependencies, and that one strong new institute should be created. The European Institute for Innovation for Health Data was born in 2016, and is now growing strongly. Working closely with Geert Thienpont, other colleagues at the University of Ghent and through guidance from our Executive Board, we are building up a European momentum that promotes Learning Health Systems, public-private multi-stakeholder collaboration and shared learning amongst peers. Our mission is to guide and catalyse the best, most efficient and trustworthy uses of health data and interoperability, for optimising health and knowledge discovery. Watch this space! www.i-hd.eu. ", "Josipa Kern": "Professor, Medical Informatics, School of Medicine, University of Zagreb President, Committee on e-Health, Croatian Academy of Medical Sciences Data analysis started in biomedical informatics, although data had never been my dream. Neither were medicine and healthcare. My background was in mathematics, with set theory and mathematical logic being my earliest concentrations. My first job, however, involved an epidemiological project, studying fat and carbohydrate metabolism indicators correlated with the occurrence of diabetes in population groups consuming animal fats and oils. So, statistics become the field that led me into biomedicine. My very first modest task was to do chi-square analyses, testing microbiological associations, which did not excite me. However, postgraduate studies in probability and statistics at the Faculty of Science opened the door towards what is now known as data science for me. Computers entered my life in the early 1970s with specific tools in a project asking for data processing, analysis and interpretation. Analysis of variance was the method required, but no computer programs implementing these techniques were to be found at the University Computer Center of the University of Zagreb in 1972 where I worked. The result was that I started programming, with Fortran my first programing language, followed by Cobol. Packages and languages like BMDP, Genstat, SS (Statistical System) and SAS came later. Data organization and databases were indispensable methods and tools applicable in my work. Working within the School of Medicine, at the Andrija Stampar School of Public Health, I kept participating in a variety of public health and related projects, mostly as a data analyst. I worked with many research teams not only in public health, but also in clinical and dentistry projects. Health and medical informatics as a subject: Informatics was a very new term when I first heard of it. Why health informatics? Why medical informatics? What is the difference? Informatics is informatics, just \u201cdata and tools for getting information\u201d, I thought then. But, working with public health professionals and clinicians I came to understand that health and medical informatics are something special, something very different. Computer scientists know a lot of technologies, mathematicians a lot of analytical methods and algorithms, health professionals a lot of medicine and healthcare, but their cooperation requires something in common. Their cooperation asks for interdisciplinarity, for health or medical informatics. The education, interdisciplinarity and cooperation were the guiding idea for my work and that of my colleagues. Medical informatics as an issue in medical education: The idea of health informatics education for medical students in Croatia originally came from Gjuro De\u017eeli\u0107 after his postdoctoral study at Indiana University (USA) in 1966. Application of computers in medicine and healthcare was the first course he introduced at a postgraduate level at the Andrija Stampar School of Medicine, covering computer and information technology and the promise that these held for medicine and healthcare. The University Computer Center provided tools and opportunities to experience how this health (or medical) informatics could contribute to the health and medical professions.  Medical informatics for students of medicine: Informatics as a subject was introduced at the graduate level of the School of Medicine in 1970. The titles of the course were the Basics of informatics and Health informatics. Medical informatics is the current title of the course tailored to the Recommendation of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) on Education in Biomedical and Health Informatics for IT users. Personal computers and computer laboratories have enabled much better medical informatics education for medical students. Medical informatics is the regular course in the medical curriculum at the School of Medicine, University of Zagreb. During the period 1970 - 2010, Medical informatics changed its position in the medical curriculum several times. It started within the third year of study, was shifted several times to other years (first, second, sixth etc.) and in 2010 its position was established at the fifth year of the medical curriculum. This was not easy to achieve, but my goal was \u201cthe position of medical informatics in the medical curriculum should be after at least one clinical course\u201d, and I insisted on it for more than 15 years (Kern 1999, Kern 2002, Kern et al 2009). The first textbook for medical students, entitled Medical Informatics, was published by the Croatian Society for Medical Informatics (CSMI), with Gjuro De\u017eeli\u0107 as the author, and included a chapter on medical decision making by me. The newest university textbook in Croatian edited by me with Mladen Petrovecki was published in 2009. There were 42 coauthors (from universities, healthcare institutions and IT companies). This textbook includes the major topics of: \u2022 Patient data (administrative, clinical, lab, biomedical signals, and medical images), \u2022 Health information systems (in primary health care, polyclinic, hospital, public health, health registries, health insurance, and laboratories), \u2022 Integration of health information systems, \u2022 Medical classifications, languages and nomenclatures, \u2022 Data organization and databases, \u2022 Internet in medicine and healthcare, \u2022 Biometry and biometric identification, \u2022 Medical decision making, \u2022 Health telematics and telemedicine, \u2022 Standardization in medical informatics, \u2022 Data protection and patient security, \u2022 Health information in medicine and healthcare, \u2022 Medical informatics education, \u2022 Dental informatics and nursing informatics, \u2022 Modeling and simulation. The specific ethical views in the book are discussed in light of The Code of Ethics for Health Informatics Professionals by IMIA. (Kern, Markota, Majdancic 2009) Medical informatics for students of nursing: Nursing at the University of Zagreb included a course Nursing informatics from the very beginning. One of the most important achievements was the thematic issue of Acta medica Croatica (2014, vol.68, no.1) journal with Information and communication technology in nursing as the topic, and papers written by students of nursing (with myself as the guest editor). Research in medical informatics: My early work in medical informatics was based mostly on the data analysis I had been doing. Being a member of a research team, I was  working on data organization and analysis for specific research projects, which continues to this day. A second phase of my career in our field included producing programs for specific procedures (programing in different computer languages) and working on the development of an easy to use statistical package (SPAK) for researchers in medicine and healthcare at our university. The applications of machine learning and statistical text analysis (qualitative analysis) were especially interesting, where I collaborated with a number of medical and healthcare researchers. Several theses and student papers were written under my supervision. Also, several courses were established at the Doctoral level in Zagreb dealing with knowledge discovery and statistical data analysis. My most recent research interests relate to the improvement of the electronic health records (EHR) in Croatia. In 2003, Croatia started to deploy an Integrated Healthcare Information System (IHIS) at the level of Primary Health Care (PHC) as the first step for connecting all other stakeholders and different levels of health care (that is, hospitals, pharmacies, laboratories) into a single enterprise healthcare network (Gvozdanovic et al., 2007). PHC is the basic level in healthcare organization in Croatia. It includes family medicine, pediatrics (for preschool and school children), school medicine (prevention for school children), gynecology, and dentistry, and every citizen should have his/her chosen PHC MD. Other specialists and hospitals (except in emergencies) are available through the referrals given by the PHC MD only. Therefore, the starting point in deploying the health information system in Croatia was the PHC. The core of the system was centralized, developed at the national level (by one vendor), and local applications (in doctors\u2019 offices) available from several vendors. All the local applications communicate with the core of IHCIS on a daily basis. All the hospitals in Croatia are not yet part of the IHCIS (just some of them, and for some functionalities, like the process of booking, sending discharge letters etc.). The Croatian Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) and their Committee on e- Health published a Declaration on e-Health where the EHR is central: \u201cevery user of health care should have his/her own unique EHR that is fed at any segments of health care\u201d. Nowadays the Committee for e-Health is working on Guidelines for improving the existing EHR. Why do we need these guidelines? Guidelines should define terminology, the reason behind the principle of \u201cone patient \u2013 one EHR\u201d, what information to get from EHR (for management, quality, public health etc.), how to protect patient through the security of his/her EHR, standardization and certification of an EHR, legal and ethical issues, who and how to participate in EHR improvements (including the health professions - associations and organizations). What are my expectations? I might be optimistic, since I expect that our future Guidelines, like Ariadne\u2019s tread, could help to develop a meaningful EHR, appropriate for all the stakeholders and for both primary and secondary use in Croatia \u2013 if we are to be able to effectively engage the health professions and other stakeholders, providing education at various levels and incorporating international standards. However, as experience internationally as well as in Croatia shows, developing such guidelines presents many very difficult challenges at the social and organizational, as well as the professional levels! Finally, what I have learned, and what and how the medical informatics education has affected my expectations for the development of the field? More than thirty years of mentoring during my university career tells me that young people have an interest in  medical informatics and data science in Croatia. I still work with some of them. ICT professionals also join us. I keep on encouraging them all, we discuss these matters and try to arrive at a consensus about them. And, as the Croatian poet (Dobrisa Cesaric) said \u201cflowing and flowing, flowing a waterfall\u2026\u201d, I feel as a drop in it\u2026 But, the waterfall is powerful\u2026 Education, education, education and cooperation, cooperation, cooperation\u2014that is the formula, and hope. BMJ, 2005; 331: 208 ", "Gunnar O. Klein": "Professor, Informatics/eHealth, Sweden, \u00d6rebro University MD, PhD, Karolinska Institutet Former chairman of CEN/TC 251 and founder of ISO/TC 215 Standards, Security, and Medical Knowledge My early interest as an 18-year old in 1972 was to work in basic cell biology research. However, in order to do so, I felt that I should start by learning some mathematics, followed soon by numerical analysis and computer science, programming in Fortran. When expecting a first child at 19, I decided to go to the medical school of the Karolinska Institute where I could probably pursue a research career and learn how to earn a living being trained as a physician. This turned out to be a good strategy in some ways. In 1975 I started as a PhD student in tumor biology while pursuing medical studies. I soon got deeply involved in a number of projects processing data from a variety of sources for my own research and that of others. I was connecting various measurement instruments to small computers and sometimes to larger minicomputers and mainframes as required. I learned a lot about hardware/software interfaces and programming in various machine languages. The lack of a common standard of communication was something that struck me very early on, and came to have a very important influence on my further path towards standardization efforts. I also had an important early industrial experience as a programming consultant to Philips bank terminal systems, which actually manufactured a small computer a few kilometers from my home that became widely sold in Europe at the time. I developed a simple operating system and various test programs, providing good additional financial support before I could start to practice as a barefoot doctor (primary care in far away places where they had no better option). Keep in mind that despite my early deep involvement in \u201ccomputing\u201d my heart was still in medicine and biology. After my PhD and physician exam I continued as a postdoc and from 1985 joined a Biotech company, Skandigen as Vice-President for research while doing various IT projects on the side. In 1987 that I left this path, and took on the challenge as the managing director of a small start-up company with some ten employees. Our focus was to use the new portable memory technologies, smart cards as well as laser optical credit card sized cards for medicine and other applications. My vision was that the patient would carry copies of all relevant professional record items on a card to ensure availability of data and at the same time protect privacy, so the patients could decide who has access to the data in a wider, and also international context. To demonstrate the capabilities required, we developed a rather advanced decision support system for prescribers which interacted with data on a patient card. Unconnected physicians could read important patient history, previous medication and issue new machine-readable prescriptions to the patient card. The patient could carry the card to the pharmacy to have the prescription filled. I managed early on to engage the large Swedish Pharmacy Corporation which at that time owned all the pharmacies in the country and had been early in introducing IT with its services. I also got to know and learn from some of the  pioneers in IMIA in Sweden Dr Hans Petersson (IMIA president 1983-86), Stellan Bengtsson (EFMI president 1991-92, VP IMIA 1994-95) and Ragnar Nordberg (long term Swedish representative to EFMI and IMIA and very acvtive in the Swedish Federation of Medical Informatics). This vision of patients of the world being able to connect to health care anywhere using their personal memory cards required standardization. In 1989 I got to know Peter Waegemann working in Boston with his Medical Records Institute. We started working informally on the \u201cPatient Cards Standards Council\u201d. However, I soon decided to pursue the formal standardization path through the formal system where existing committees in CEN, the European standards federation were willing to host us through one technical group TC 224/Wg12 and the more medical content-oriented CEN/TC 251/WG 7. We developed a number of European standards defining characteristics of patient cards in the early-to-mid 1990s. I am very pleased to have followed through the formation of the international ISO/TC 215 committee and publications as international standards some 12-20 years later. These are actually used in many countries not only in Europe but also in Asia and to some degree in other continents. Personally though, I became more and more interested in security of health information systems. New technologies with the development of the high capacity internet, with mobile networks connecting virtually all health care facilities globally allows a wealth of opportunities but important security features had to be developed and deployed. My previous \u201cbaby\u201d, the smart cards became important tools for this as a holder of cryptographic keys and core algorithmic processing. Through a combination of work in the EU research program, the formal standardization in Sweden and in Europe with commercial activities, I had the opportunity to play important roles in these developments. I became chair of the European standardization working group (and from 1998 the ISO working group) on security of health informatics, and we developed in very good cooperation a series of standards for managing this which in many ways are still at the heart of many health information communication systems. The ISO 17090 Health informatics \u2013 Public key infrastructure \u2013 parts 1-5 are at the heart of this but some technical aspects we started in Sweden are also at the core of all inter-sector uses of smart card PKI security in the ISO 7816-15 standard. One aspect of the development of using cryptographic services for health which is now largely forgotten, is the fact that in the early-to-mid 1990s national security agencies in the US and many European countries were actively trying to stop this development because they wanted to be able to listen to all communication, including sensitive health data. Gradually, my interests in medical informatics grew into covering general information modelling, terminology, ontologies and decision support. In 1997, I took over the leadership of all of the European Standardization of Health informatics in the CEN/TC 251, the committee started by Georges De Moor. This was for me an extremely stimulating time lasting nine years until 2006. I got very wide contacts with research in Medical informatics, political strategies to introduce what was termed eHealth especially in Europe and in co-operation with the European Commission. But this was also a time for me to expand my already rather extensive international experiences to meet key people in IMIA and through the ISO/TC 215 which Peter Waegemann and I started in 1998. Many leading persons from different countries included Ed Hammond, Stan Huff, Woody Bealer, Chris Chute, Peter Elkin, Gary Dickinson of the US, Dr. Hyeoun-Ae Park and Yun Sik Kwak of Korea, Ray Rogers, Stephen Kay, Barry Barber, Alan Rector,  Robin Hopkins, David Markwell, and Dipak Kalra from UK. Many other important persons come to mind among the medical informaticians from other countries I have worked with: Jean-Marie Rodrigues, Patrice Degoulet, Marie-Christine Jaulent and Fran\u00e7ois Mennerat from France, Georges De Moor and Francis Roger France of Belgium, Bernd Blobel, Otto Rienhoff and Rolf Engelbrecht from Germany. From the year of 2005 I was introduced to work of formal ontologies through Barry Smith, the English philosopher now a professor in Buffalo and to my great pleasure we managed to resolve different backgrounds and come to a common recommendation for terminology experts. In addition, we became friends for life. I have had the pleasure of working on many different important topics, with very interesting colleagues. One of the most important experiences have been with developing countries. A most important collaborator is Yunkap Kwankham who, as head of WHO eHealth strongly supported standards bodies for collaborating and providing knowledge for less resourced countries. For a number of years we co-chaired the global eHealth standardization co-ordination group where seven of the globally relevant bodies presented their work and tried to co- ordinate and resolve gaps. It was an important effort and we increased the acknowledgement of the importance of Health Information Standards as part of the global strategy of WHO and many countries. However, we were less successful in getting all the bodies like HL7, CEN and ISO to really work together, though a lot of mutual understanding and several examples of good co-operation have emerged. Today I have the opportunity to work with projects and PhD students from Mozambique and Rwanda which is very rewarding. Another country I have had a special relation with over the past 15 years is China. This started when my new unit, the Centre for Health Telematics at Karolinska from 1996 had a website which attracted two bright young physicians from Shanghai who wanted to come for a PhD to me in Stockholm. They came and we started many activities which led to extensive contacts with academics, government people and businesspeople in China. I had the opportunity to lecture at various universities and conferences on things like semantic interoperability, modern security structures, and of course, the global standardization efforts. I met with both representatives of the very modern advanced scientific medicine, the health minister Chen Chu, to whom I provided a couple of hours of personal advice on a possible strategy for China. I am pleased that China has become very active in IMIA and hosted MEDINFO in 2017. China has also joined the global standardization efforts in ISO/TC 215 and many of the core standards for PKI, EHR, and HISA has been translated and issued as national Chinese standards. My experiences with some of the colleagues of other countries would be very incomplete if I did not mention my recent period 2011-2012 as professor of Health Informatics in the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, Norway. I have worked with a number of Norwegian academics also active internationally, such as Gunnar Hartvigsen and Gustaf Bellika in Troms\u00f6, Anders Grimsmo, Eric Monteiro and Arild Faxvaag in Trondheim and Petter Hurlen and Anne Moen in Oslo. Today, my professional base is in a relatively small university, \u00d6rebro in Sweden which is heavily integrated with the regional government health organization and I also practice as a primary care physician one day a week. My heart lies, though, very much in the international co-operation of health informatics recently including extensive co- operation with the pharmaceutical industry in the EHR for Clinical Research projects and the EU collaborations for the elderly with multiple diseases. ", "Sabine Koch": "President, IMIA (2019 \u2013 2021) Professor of Health Informatics, Health Informatics Centre Department of Learning, Informatics, Management and Ethics, Karolinska Institutet Like most other people working in the field of biomedical and health informatics, I am driven by the vision to make health and social care better, safer and more targeted to individual needs. My career path was never planned but I was lucky to find myself in some exciting health informatics places at the right time to meet inspiring researchers and practitioners. After finishing high school, I did an apprenticeship in information technology and economics. Afterwards, I wanted to study informatics in combination with an application area. A S. Koch, MSc, PhD, FACMI, documentary about 3D image visualization featuring MIAHSI Peter Meinzer\u2019s group at the German Cancer Research Centre in Heidelberg inspired me to study medical informatics at Heilbronn Technical University and the Ruprecht-Karls University in Heidelberg, Germany where I received my MSc degree in 1993. I was determined to do my master\u2019s thesis abroad and got into contact with Werner Schneider, head of the Center for Human-Computer Interaction at Uppsala University, Sweden who was also the head of UDAC (a university-owned IT&T service organisation). This turned out to be the beginning of my academic career in this challenging field. In Uppsala I was able to combine my education in medical informatics with work in the field of human-computer interaction, joining the group led by Werner Schneider and Ina-Veronika Wagner doing fascinating dental informatics research. We investigated and developed holistic concepts for integrated patient support for dental offices and clinics. At this time my research interest was in medical imaging, researching novel methods for automatic quality assessment and controlled diagnostic enhancement of digital (or digitized) intraoral radiographs and orthopantomographs. Dental informatics had the advantage of applying the entire health informatics methodological spectrum in a well- defined and constrained clinical field, and many of the methods that we developed, specifically user-centred design methods, proved applicable to other clinical areas. Since 2000, I have widened the scope of my research from dentistry to health and social care more generally, and especially home care. We introduced mobile informatics solutions for collaboration between health and social care professionals, elderly patients and their next-of-kin. We explored new methods for user needs and requirements- elicitation in collaborative care settings, provided solutions in the form of a virtual health record accessible through mobile devices, and evaluated them from various perspectives and according to different criteria. In 2005, I built up the first Centre for eHealth in Sweden which was set up as an interdisciplinary research centre spanning the faculties of medicine, technology and social sciences of Uppsala University. Researchers involved had different scientific backgrounds, and besides health informatics included information science, information technology, human-computer interaction, medical law and ethics, economics as well as medicine and nursing.  In 2008, I was named to the Strategic Professorship in health informatics at Karolinska Insitutet in Stockholm where my group studies similar methods for collaboration and decision making in several areas such as stroke care, intensive care and acute care, with increasing focus on the patient\u2019s role and shared decision making. I have always enjoyed both the interdisciplinarity of our field and the international collaborations and networks which IMIA and all its member organisations promote. I became involved in IMIA in 2010 as representative for the Swedish Medical Informatics Association, was IMIA treasurer for 2012-2017, and as current IMIA President I have the goal of encouraging and helping junior colleagues and students especially to get engaged in this exciting field. Lessons learned and outlook. I can see that research such as our early work at the intersection between medical informatics and human-computer interaction is receiving increasing attention and emphasis. Twenty-five years ago, usability, human factors and related matters were often considered as add-ons, if at all. When implementing IT applications, usability aspects were not integrated into the system development process. Consciousness about usability issues has radically changed even if it is often still frustrating to see that our research developments are only slowly picked-up in clinical practice. Apart from other issues related to the clinical implementation process itself, many IT applications are not adapted to users\u2019 needs and thus not used or not used as intended, which prevents the expected benefits from being achieved. On the other hand, many IT applications are not built on rigorous information models and thus not scalable. We need to systematically build on each other\u2019s research results to make progress in the science and also to ensure that our research results are well-applied and implemented in practice. With the advent of new sources of health data, we can observe some current trends: \u2022 Clinical research is moving towards personalised and precision medicine; \u2022 Health care providers are eager to measure the effects of their actions and to build what are now designated as learning health care systems; \u2022 Data science is the new buzzword in computer science, albeit not clearly distinguishable from conventional statistical methods for data mining plus visualization techniques; and \u2022 Patients start measuring themselves and analyse their own data to personalize their treatment. From this we can see that the biomedical and health informatics community needs to find ways to build data models to systematically extract, and link data along the continuum of care including their context, and produce results according to research agendas that are driven by patient needs. ", "Klaus A. Kuhn": "Director, Institute of Medical Informatics, Statistics & Epidemiology President & VP, GMDS (2007-2011) Chair, Dept. of Medical Informatics, Univ. of Marburg (1996-2004) Chair, IMIA WG Health Information Systems (2000-2006) Coordinator, DIFUTURE Project (2018-2021) In the 1980s, when I worked as a physician, it was much less the lack of knowledge but the lack of information which we suffered from. In emergency admission units and K.A. Kuhn, Dipl. Inform., during nights on duty in the hospital, the challenge was to Dipl. Math., Dr. med., Dr. med. Habil, FACMI quickly get information about the documented problems of the patient, the medication, and the test results. So my first project was simple: when the old typewriters used to write discharge letters in our 300- bed University hospital were replaced by PCs, we stored these letters, reconciled the patients\u2019 identifying data with the hospital\u2019s SAP system and made them electronically available to the emergency admission and to other units. This bridged the gap between discharge and re-admission, and it presented a short but comprehensive overview: our colleagues\u2019 reactions where overwhelmingly positive. The work of electronic health records pioneers like Ed Hammond and Octo Barnett fascinated me, and we improved the system continuously. Next, the \u201cnon-perfectibility of man\u201d, described in an impressive way by Clem Mc Donald, became our issue: we saw that structured reporting was able to reduce the numbers of errors of omission, and we began to develop systems which worked successfully. While I had not been sure if I should turn towards biometry or biomedical informatics, I became convinced that there was more need for innovation in medical informatics. I was lucky to meet Peter L. Reichertz personally, and I was about to join his institute when he died unexpectedly\u2014what a loss for the field. But I continued my way with health information systems, trying to bridge the gap between computer science and medicine. So when I became a professor of medical informatics in Marburg in the mid 1990\u2019s, I immediately accepted the offer to serve as CIO for the University Medical Center. Being responsible for an institution with more than 1,000 beds, cooperation with industry became a major concern of mine. We designed interactions and workflows, trying to push innovative ideas forward. From 2000, I served as the chair of the IMIA health information systems working group. Ab Bakker, the previous chair, was a teacher for me, and I was lucky to be able to invite the leaders of the field to Heidelberg in 2002, including Paul Clayton, Clem McDonald, Nancy Lorenzi, Patti Brennan, Ed Hammond, Patrice Degoulet, Charlie Safran, Antoine Geissbuhler, Enrico Coiera, Stan Huff, Charles Friedman, Joan Ash, Marion Ball and many more. Another IMIA working conference in Lisbon and MEDINFO 2007 followed, providing opportunities to continue the discussions. Moving from Marburg to TU Munich, one of Germany\u2019s universities of excellence, opened the opportunity to work very closely with leading biomedical and clinical researchers. Again following the most urgent need, I turned towards integrating highly heterogeneous data. A straightforward consequence was to become aware of security and privacy risks. The EU projects BioMedBridges and BBMRI were in need of concepts for data protection. The close relationships to Vanderbilt which had started with Nancy Lorenzi and Dario Giuse also brought us close to Brad Malin and his impressive health  information privacy lab. Recently, Fabian Prasser from my institution and Brad started to put innovative approaches to data de-identification into practice, by integrating the game-theoretic methodology developed at Vanderbilt into the ARX tool, which has been developed at TU Munich. One of my very recent activities has been to organize a consortium of TU Munich, University of Munich, University of T\u00fcbingen, and more partners, funded with about 30 million Euros over four years. We will follow our vision to provide secure and privacy-preserving data integration in order to make significant progress towards the medicine of the future, which will be preventive and personalized, but also digitalized and participatory. Methods of Information in Medicine 2008; 47, 283-95 ", "Simon de Lusignan": "Senior Academic GP and Clinical Informatician (1987- ) BCS Health & Care Executive (2003- ) Chair, EFMI Primary Care Inform WG (2003-19) & UK/BCS rep (2009- ) Editor, Journal of Innovation in Health Informatics (2007- ) EFMI Board, Publications Officer (2014-19) First memories and early years: My first memories of computing and technology was a visit from my junior school to the then Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) at S. de Lusignan, MD, FRCGP, FBCS, CITP, FACHI, FCI Fellow Harwell in Oxfordshire, to visit their computer! This was a vast whirring machine, with magnetic, and as I remember even punch tapes. I remember being inspired by this and building a balsa wood model that converted binary numbers into decimal\u2014though only up to 16! My next brief brush with computers was when a medical student, in 1979. We had the privilege of being able to \u201cintercalate\u201d a BSc into our medical course. I opted for biochemistry, and as part of my lab project looking at rates of reaction there was the opportunity to use a computer programme. I also started to be interested in technology and for my surgical project wrote about nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). NMR is more usually referred to as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) now. I was interested if you could overlay phosphate NMR over protons to look at tissue viability\u2026My presentation caused excitement because the professor of surgery thought I was going to present about \u201cEnemas\u201d\u2014rather than \u201cNMR.\u201d I moved to my current general practice, Woodbridge Hill Surgery, in Guildford in 1987. I worked full-time there for the first eight years. I, and my practice got involved with a very small computer company called \u201cCompract\u201d and installed a really early computer system in the 1990s. Up until then we had used an age-sex register (a set of small cards, one per registered patient in the practice) with holes punched in to signify immunisations or other preventive procedures. Non-attenders were identified by sorting these punched cards with a knitting needle! Such was the state of 1980s and 1990s general practice information technology. Improving our \u201cinformation system\u201d\u2014the paper medical record\u2014generally involved creating new cards, such as summary, antenatal or prescribing record cards. Any audit of quality required a sample of people to be identified from their age-sex record card and then looking through their paper record. A next important time for me was the recruiting of general practices to take part in the Fourth National Morbidity Survey in General Practice (MSGP4). This was a survey of illness and disease alongside the national census. Practice consultation data had to include a problem title, ideally a diagnosis and this had to be classified into being \u201cfirst, new or ongoing\u201d (the FNO system). This was new to me\u2014but of fundamental importance if an understanding of the nature of GP clinical work was to be captured. There were two final opportunities that led to my academic development. The first was my first academic appointment and the second was the creation of one of the first primary care research networks \u201cSTaRNet\u201d\u2014the South Thames NHS Region Research Network. My first academic appointment came out of my involvement with taking medical students into my practice from St. George\u2019s medical school in London. The late  Paul Freeling, then head of primary care visited my practice and was very interested in our early computer system and what we were doing. He phoned a few days later and said \u201cComputers are going to be big in medicine, how about coming and doing a day a week at St. George\u2019s.\u201d I had some beginner\u2019s luck and achieved grant funding for my first projects as well as achieving my first publications and became the information technology lead for STaRNet. First projects and early research years: My first project reflected the very early phase of development of informatics and that I was on a steep learning curve! I worked in four areas: 1. Using routine data collected using computerised medical record (CMR) systems to measure quality; 2. Information to support better decision making; 3. Direct observation of the use of CMR systems, generally using video methods; and 4. Remote monitoring of patients\u2014at that time called telemedicine. The Doctors Desk was a first attempt to create a graphical interface linking all the online information that might be required. This then developed into a National Electronic Library project. However, the growth of search engines and bibliographic databases made this approach obsolete. I learned a lot about information retrieval and how in busy consultations practitioners need to know where to find information. With a colleague and fellow GP Nigel Hague, we set up the Primary Care Data Quality Project (PCDQ), which provided feedback based on the data in CMR systems about the quality of care that was being delivered. It used a common data extraction tool, now discontinued\u2014called Morbidity Information Query and Export Syntax (MIQUEST)\u2014to extract data from what at the time were many different brands of GP CMR system, and present them back compared with their peer and the evidence-base. We called this intervention \u201cAudit-Based Education (ABE).\u201d Video recording was well established as a training tool for GPs and I adapted this, along with screen capture, to explore the role of the computer in the context of the clinical consultation. My first video study was the impact of technology on a nurse run clinic for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. I also undertook one of the early telemonitoring studies in primary care. Learning opportunities: There were many learning opportunities in the first part of my career and I will pick out the most important. Having arrived as an academic at St George\u2019s I was one of the few without postgraduate academic qualifications, other than those as a family practitioner. I embarked on an excellent MSc shared between Surrey, Rotterdam, and Manchester. This is regrettably long gone but introduced us all to the socio-technical school\u2019s way of thinking. I subsequently wrote my doctoral thesis on the barriers to coding clinical data in primary care CMR systems. I foresaw the importance of coded data. Through it I developed my own theory about the factors that contributed to whether technology was used, including coding data. There were four elements that needed to be aligned: (1) The organisation (at several levels); (2) The individual clinician; (3) The clinical task in hand (many don\u2019t lend themselves to valid coding); and (4) The technology itself.  The British Computer Society (BCS) was and remains one of the most important factors. The key elements of the BCS, for me, were its Health and Care Executive, its Primary Health Care Specialist Group, and its journal - formerly the Journal of Informatics in Primary Care and more recently renamed the Journal of Innovation in Health Informatics. I have enjoyed a long innings as its Editor in Chief. BCS is open - its members share ideas and experience, and it has been an extraordinarily valuable experience. The UK CMR national user groups, by discussing uses of a particular brand of computer system, are extremely valuable. They are among the largest GP conferences in England, and the place to go if you want to know if something works or is usable at all! The European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) and its primary health care specialist groups provide considerable opportunities for community and learning. It was initially a shock to me how whilst medicine is fairly similar across the developed world the extent to which the \u201corganisation\u201d\u2014the health system\u2014drove how CMR systems were developed. Though EFMI I acquired a range of important national and international collaborators. AMIA and IMIA have also been important. AMIA has fantastic meetings, so does IMIA through MEDINFO. However, there is something to be learned about how AMIA\u2019s stable North American organisation has been able to grow its conferences in a way that the rotating systems in IMIA and EFMI find hard to match. One of my biggest learning opportunities was setting up a Biomedical Informatics undergraduate programme. The course spanned from bioinformatics through to public health and health care management informatics. This was set up across three Universities\u2014St George\u2019s in London, where I was based; Kingston University; and Royal Holloway\u2014University of London. It was a fantastic course, but not really the one Universities wanted and it fell a casualty to the collapse of these institutions then-planned closer working together; though Kingston and St George\u2019s remain close collaborators. However, some of its graduates have gone on to great things in informatics, public health, medicine, and management. Later projects: My later projects have focussed on quality improvement and how routine data can better be used to monitor health outcomes. The Quality Improvement in the Chronic Kidney Disease (QICKD) trial is one of my biggest\u2014and used audit-based- education to feedback about quality. The trial saw a positive outcome for the intervention arm! I have carried out quite a lot of work in diabetes and in common mental health problems, again with monitoring and outcomes measured from routine data. Direct observation of the consultation has continued. I have completed research directly looking at the clinical consultation. This was largely carried out with Pushpa Kumarapeli, and the ALFA toolkit\u2014a multichannel video toolkit\u2014was the pinnacle of this development. However, the work continues with comparing non-GPs with GPs in the clinical consultation and in looking at the impact of the CMR in consultation with diabetics. A clinical informatician directing the national primary care surveillance system: My most recent work, and largest project since 2015 had been to take over the directorship of the national primary care surveillance system. The English National system is the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC). This is one of Europe\u2019s oldest surveillance system (www.rcgp.org.uk/rsc) working in collaboration with national public health bodies for over 51 years. The RCGP RSC was the organisation responsible for MSGP4 all those years before, and that now has a major role in flu and other infectious disease monitoring, and in assessing vaccine effectiveness.  However, the RCGP RSC systems had scope for considerable updating\u2014in many dimensions. My innovations have incorporated much of clinical informatics learning over the previous three decades, and include: \u2022 Industry standard tools that enable much faster processing of large volumes of data\u2014I have grown the network from <1 million registered patients to >3.75 million registered patients. \u2022 Extracted individual level pseudonymised data which enables it to be linked to hospital and death data. \u2022 Created innovative links within the data so that we can compare rural, urban and conurbation dwellers and define households, so we can also look at household transmission of disease. My next endeavour with RCGP RSC is to stitch together its 50 years of historic data into the same format so we can know much more about the changes in infectious disease of this time period. Reflection: informatics has remained the epiphenomenon: Throughout my career my clinical informatics has been the epiphenomenon. I have professionally been an academic and now a senior academic GP with the informatics my sub-speciality. I could not until the last couple of years have even opted to re-validate with our medical licensing body (the General Medical Council) as a clinical informatician until very recently. The good news is that nobody in informatics seems to worry about this at all, you are regardless made very welcome! On balance I think the lack of a formal academic and professional sub-speciality in clinical informatics has not been a good thing. Whilst I have been and remain part of an open community, it was one, particularly in the UK, that didn\u2019t write things down. Much of the learning of the primary health care specialist groups, from user-group conferences, etc. has not been recorded and has been lost. Maybe the lack of an academic community, and departments of clinical informatics in UK Universities has also exacerbated these problems. Unlike many researchers who are really specialised both in my medicine and informatics I have considered myself a generalist steeped in informatics, real world data and a drive to do thinks better. My final comment for any possible readers would be: wherever possible conduct scientific studies, and when you can\u2019t, \u201cWrite it down!\u201d Journal of Innovation in Health Informatics, 2006; 14:203-209 ", "John Mantas": "Professor, Medical & Health Informatics University of Athens President, EFMI (2010 \u2013 2013) Coordinator for Greece, Erasmus Inter-University Cooperation Programme (1989-1998) What we are, what defines us, is mostly the accumulation of the efforts of others who influence us. Therefore, for this life journey, I would like to thank my late parents and my late older brother for providing me an ethical baseline and continuous support; my late uncle, the clinical physician, who gave me the incentives to understand and probe the healthcare field in a humanistic way; my beloved wife Marianna for being beside me and tolerating me for more than 30 years; my teachers at all levels of education who let me dream of a better world; and in particular my Doctoral supervisor Alan Heaton of the University of Manchester, who convinced me to continue my PhD studies and provided me with the appropriate financial support in those difficult years of the late 1970\u2019s.

Being a member of such an important organization, I have gathered during those many years a wealth of experiences and knowledge from the accumulated wisdom of my colleagues. I have to express my sincere thanks to my colleagues and friends on the Council for their trust in letting me lead them as EFMI President much later on, in 2010 (see my acceptance speech below). One of my main tasks during those years on the Board and as President, was to prepare updated versions of our statutes and legally register our Federation with the Swiss authorities. Formal registration would later allow EFMI to participate as a partner in European- funded research projects. Developing a legal document for the statutes of an international organization is a complicated task, as our membership is not comprised of physical persons but national associations and institutions represented by persons. Besides that, EFMI is a scientific society where the working groups play an equally important role, which must also be reflected in the statutes. The latest version of the Statutes, being the current endorsed version of the EFMI Constitution, balances equally the three pillars of EFMI: the national associations, the institutions (both academic and corporate), and the working groups. In addition, the elections and the roles of the Board members and the President are now direct, open, transparent, democratic, and reflect the wishes of the Council, without hidden nominations and agendas. My IMIA induction. During the years in EFMI, I served also as WG Chair or Co- Chair on Education. I was fortunate and honored to serve also as IMIA WG Chair on Education. Thanks to the encouragement of Reinhold Haux, I led the Task Force to revise the Educational Recommendations. The experience was productive, as both the  communities of EFMI and IMIA, in their rarest but most fruitful moments, worked together to develop the Revised Version of the Educational Recommendations, which have been accepted by the international community. A lesson learned is that when you set a specific scientific goal, then you may overcome barriers, be they objective or even psychological and cultural. IMIA has taught us or should have taught us to overcome prejudices and stereotypes of any nature, without divisions between north and south, east and west, and to think about the big picture and what lies beyond the horizon. Education in biomedical and health informatics available to all healthcare professionals at all levels is the means to make our field strong, with an ever-lasting impact on healthcare. As classical philosophers said in the past, but Nelson Mandela reiterated: \u201cEducation is the most powerful weapon you can use to change the world\u201d. Health Informatics in Greece. In Greece in the late seventies, only a few hospital- based seminars and courses were taught on the principles of computer science to an audience of healthcare professionals as part of their continuing education, preparing them to accept the political decision to implement the early hospital information systems. At that time, no formal academic courses existed. Related formal courses were those included in the traditional Medical Physics courses already implemented a decade earlier in most Medical and Nursing Schools. Teaching those seminars at that time was a unique experience for me as a young scientist. In Greece during the early 1980\u2019s, formal courses started to appear in curricula in the Nursing School of the University of Athens. The lack of computer skills made it appropriate to introduce an Introduction to Informatics as the first officially taught course combining a laboratory practicum. At a later stage, a separate course was introduced: that of medical informatics. As there was a strong objection by most of the conservative faculty members to new subjects as courses within the official curriculum of a traditional Nursing academic programme, it was difficult to have both the above mentioned courses accepted as obligatory within the curriculum, so one course was accepted as obligatory and the other as optional. Due to the lack of computer skills among the freshman students in the first years of this initiation, the obligatory course was the Introduction to Informatics and the optional one was the Medical Informatics course later renamed Health Informatics. Exactly the opposite occurred in early 1990\u2019s when the computer skills of the incoming students were at an appropriate level. Both Medical Schools of the University of Athens and the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki introduced Informatics courses as optional modules for a rather select but limited audience of undergraduates in the late 1980\u2019s. It is worth mentioning for historical reasons that in 1988, the course taught within the undergraduate curriculum of the Nursing School of the University of Athens changed from Medical Informatics to Health Informatics. It is the first time in the literature that we encounter an official use of the term for a course, which was accepted very late at the end of the 1990\u2019s and beginning of the 2000\u2019s as the appropriate generic term reflecting our field. The initiatives of the European Commission. It was around 1986 when one of the professors in my Faculty approached me and informed me of a forthcoming new initiative of the European Commission. He was very close to the Minister of Research and Technology, so he had very reliable information. A couple of months after this information, I received an official invitation to represent the Ministry of Research of Greece at the official meeting of the European Commission to initiate the new programme. On the flight to Brussels, I met two colleagues, N. Pallikarakis and the late S. Orphanoudakis. Both had received similar invitations to join the meeting. In Brussels,  we met a number of other European colleagues for the first time, among them R. Engelbrecht, M. Stefanelli, and Georges De Moor, representing their institutions. One of the important persons having initiated the meeting was Dr. W. von Eimeren. In the meeting, they announced the new programme by the European Commission, the Advanced Informatics in Medicine (AIM), pending financial approval by the European Parliament. A call for bids for exploratory action projects was imminent. At my next visit to the University of Manchester, one month later, I passed this information on to my friend and colleague Costas Daskalakis, lecturer at the Computer Science Department, who told me to inform a new Reader of the Faculty, very much involved in Medical Informatics, Dr. Alan Rector, who had recently arrived from the US. In one year\u2019s time the new projects approved were Eurodiabeta (R. Engelbrecht), Precise (R. Engelbrecht), Euclides (Georges De Moor), Gen Architecure for Medical Expert Systems (M. Stefanelli), and Galen (A. Rector). My friend Costas left the University of Manchester and became project officer at the European Commission (EC), and later Director of a Unit at the EC. An Erasmus Inter-University Cooperation Programme (also a programme funded by the European Commission) had as its target education in Health Informatics at the MSc level. The programme was funded from 1989 to 1998 by Erasmus in two phases. The first phase developed a curriculum in the field of Health Informatics at the MSc level after an international workshop organised in Athens, and the second phase was the implementation of the programme by exchanging both professors and students among six European Universities at the beginning of the implementation with 20 European Universities that were at the mature stage of the programme. The first six European Universities/Institutions were: University of Athens, Polytechnical University of Madrid, University of Gent, City University London, University of Pavia, and the University of Manchester. The programme was coordinated by me at the University of Athens, and the overall evaluation stated that it was a very successful coordinated effort despite the huge logistical overload and the very small funding support by Erasmus for a programme with no registration fees for the students. The MSc education was available until 1997/1998. The aim of this curriculum that started in 1990 was to give those working or intending to work in the field of healthcare a broad advanced postgraduate education in health informatics in order to develop their ability to understand and evaluate in detail the theoretical and practical requirements of informatics in medicine, nursing, and healthcare. The course enrolled students from different European countries and also had lecturers from several European countries (35 in total). The official title of the Erasmus programme established in 1989 was MSc in Health Informatics. The term Health Informatics was for the first time used in an official academic programme and as an academic title to represent our field. The NIGHTINGALE (Nursing Informatics Generic High-level Training in Informatics for Learning & Education) project, again an EU-financed project, was also approved in 1995, and I was the principal investigator (coordinator). The project was considered essential for planning and implementing a strategy to train the nursing profession in using and applying healthcare information systems. The project was based on previous experiences in the Telenursing AIM project and the EDUCTRA Concerted Action, which partially touched on the subject of the education and training of the nursing profession. The main goal of the project was to bring to the surface, by means of a series of workshops, the user needs of the nursing profession with respect to telematics, to develop a nursing informatics curriculum for European nurses, and to develop educational tools and software assisting the educational process in nursing informatics.  A number of European Conferences on Health Telematics education were also organized, and a textbook in health informatics for nurses was compiled. My EFMI President\u2019s acceptance speech, EFMI STC 2010 (EFMI Council) Reykjavik, 04.06.2010. I had always wished to address this Council (General Assembly) of EFMI in Greek, but I realized that it would have indeed been Greek to all present in this room. I found out, however, that I could make my address in Greek that would still be English to everybody. With your permission, Mr. Chairman, I shall do it now, using, except for articles and prepositions, only Greek words. \u201cKyrie, I eulogize the archons of this Panethnic Synod of EFMI for the orthodoxy of their axioms, methods, policies, and epistemological logos. With enthusiasm we dialogue and synagonize at all synods of EFMI and at our parallel organizations in which polymorphous epistemological ideas and dogmas are analyzed and synthesized. Our critical problems such as the numismatic Euro problems generate some agony and melancholy both in Iceland and Greece. This phenomenon is characteristic of our epoch. But, to my thesis, we have the dynamism to program therapeutic practices as a prophylaxis from chaos and catastrophe within Europe. EFMI is Pan-European and is based on organizational and epistemological synergy and harmonization in a democratic climate for the hygeia of Europe. I apologize for my eccentric monologue for having tyrannized you with my Hellenic phraseology. I emphasize my eucharistia to you Kyrie, to the eugenic and generous European Ethnos and to the organizers and protagonists of this Amphictyony and the Gastronomic Symposia. Kathigitis Ioannis Mantas\u201d Studies in Health Technology and Informatics, 2017; 238:276-279 ", "Victor Maojo": "Professor of Artificial Intelligence, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid FACMI, FIAHSI I studied medicine in Oviedo, Spain from 1979 to 1985\u2014MD degrees require six years in Spain. I have no memories whatsoever of hearing anything about the use of computers in medicine during those years. I believe that no faculty member ever mentioned any computer medical application, except for radiology. At the time, most Spanish hospitals had few clinical V. Maojo, MD, PhD applications though there were many for administration, radiology, and laboratory medicine. The only event, vaguely related to computers, which nevertheless intrigued me, was the presentation, which I attended, of an MD dissertation by Dr Ramon Cacabelos, who later became well known in Spain. His topic fascinated me from when I first heard of it: \u201cis it possible to create a complete neurocybernetic model of the brain?\u201d After listening to his doctoral lecture in my third year, I began to read about computer systems and applications, and bought myself a small Sinclair, my first computer. Then, I began to think, without any reference at hand, about what might be the possibilities of medical computer applications - but there were no interesting books or publications in our library. Then, just as I was finishing my MD studies, I went one day to our hospital library. A friend got me a pass and then spent three days searching INDEX MEDicus days (equivalent to five minutes searching with Pubmed today) for references of anything like \u201ccomputers in medicine\u201d. The term \u201cmedical informatics\u201d was not widely used at the time, so the search was really difficult and tedious. However, the results, back in 1985, were already exciting, since I found that the literature was already quite large. Of course, it was almost impossible (and really expensive if I tried) to get any paper published in medical informatics journals, but that same day I was able to get copies of various papers from journals such as the NEJM and JAMA. And one of them, by William Schwartz, from 1970\uf8e7who also had inspired so many fifteen years before\uf8e7was the one that made me wonder about whether I should seriously consider entering the field. I asked many colleagues and professors what they thought about exploring the idea of my studying computer science (which had to be done in either Madrid, Barcelona or Valencia) and almost everybody told me that I was completely crazy. The only person who helped me was my cousin, who, reassured my poor, frightened mother who thought that I would ruin my life and end up working in a bank. He was a Full professor of veterinary medicine, who seemed more open to new ideas, after working in a University in Philadelphia. He told my mother, under severe questionning, that the topic was completely alien to him, but the idea might be sound and probably had a good future. As result, I moved to Madrid, without knowing anyone there or whether I might find someone working in the field who might help me. First, I registered for a computer science degree, and after a few months, anxiously waiting, I entered my first freshman class. After several months of classes of calculus, algebra, chemistry, physics\uf8e7and almost nothing directly related to computers\uf8e7I became a strange kind of object of interest. Three compassionate professors almost at the same time, recommended that I see Professor Pazos, a specialist in AI. I visited him, and  he immediately invited me to his lab, where\uf8e7by some strange chance\uf8e7there were two other newcomers interested in the same topic, Alejandro Pazos and Fernando Martin- Sanchez, who have become well-known biomedical informaticians. After taking courses on various topics during the next few years, my first research project with these two colleagues was to build a prototype expert system for medical triage of catastrophes, which we successfully completed, copyrighted and presented at various conferences. However, life was not easy outside the lab, either. We visited, with our medical expert, a renowed military physician, the director of the Spanish National Agency for Civil Emergencies, who was enthusiastic about the idea...but advised us: \u201cSorry, you come ten years too early, we are not yet ready for these ideas...\u201d. I also remember the first question that I got, from the audience, at a medical conference: \u201cbut you don\u2019t realize that during catastrophes, there will be no energy to turn on your computer?\u201d These were not easy times, but I always received support from many people and agencies and was always able, from the beginning, to get some financial support for my studies, from local and national agencies, for which I was deeply grateful. After having switched professions, I was able to completed MSc and PhD degrees at the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM), and shortly afterwards obtained a faculty appointment at the Complutense University of Madrid (UCM). Between 1990 to 1993, I was a visiting professor at Georgia Tech together with with Professor Norberto Ezquerra, and later a Research Fellow at Harvard-MIT with Professor Bob Greenes. Returning to Spain, I took the lead of the biomedical informatics group in 1993. With a borrowed PC, I began my research work there. Quite early, a generous $200K grant from Hewlett- Packard, USA\uf8e7huge by Spanish standards at the time\uf8e7allowed us to acquire the hardware needed for our work. I remember our excitement when a truck loaded with expensive computers delivered them, and filled our almost empty space, to the envy of all our faculty neighbors. Since that time, my research interests have broadened, from public health to nanotechnology. I have worked with colleagues on catastrophe management, expert systems and various other topics\uf8e7see below\uf8e7but my personal vision has been mostly focused on the access and integration of remote and heterogeneous data and information. Not only as a physician and informatician, but also as a patient. In 1994 I was diagnosed with a complex and difficult medical problem, which appeared to lead me to becoming completely deaf in one ear. At a time when there were still only very rudimentary web engines, and searches were mostly done manually (still remarkably similar to what I had done in my initial experience with INDEX MEDICUS), I found a possible solution, browsing pages and pages over many weeks, when I found a new website at the Massachussets General Hospital where I read \u201cin some cases, hearing can be preserved with surgery...\u201d. And there I was, probably one of the first cases of web users trying to find, desperately, a medical solution, which, to make a long stroy short, led me to Boston, where the late Dr Ojemann, himself a legendary expert in my problem, generously advised me to go to Hannover, Germany, where Dr Sammi was able to save my hearing. I have never published my case, since patients usually prefer not to get personal citations, quite unlike most scholars\uf8e7for obvious reasons! But the difficult search that I needed to carry out was just a sign that better informatics methods were necessary to help researchers, physicians and patients how to search, retrieve, gather and use medical information in an intelligent manner. As result, my collaborators and I have carried out much research on database integration, text mining, information retrieval, NLP, semantic interoperability, ontologies, and related topics, which have been, widely reported. As an example, my group, since 2001, has pioneered work on clinico-genomic integration of  databases, and afterwards related work on integrating EHRs with results from clinical trials. Since 2007, I have also worked on data and information integration in the area of nanoinformatics, a new field where we have been quite active. Working in the latter area, looking one day at a drawing of a number of nanoparticles and how they were represented by a series of terms in a nanoparticle ontology, I envisioned the idea of a visual ontology, where classes would be shapes, and relations would be mathematical, instead of semantic, suggesting the idea of new visual taxonomies. Maybe\uf8e7hopefully\uf8e7these ideas will be picked up and developed further by others in the future. From an academic perspective, I have led quite a number of national and international projects. I have coordinated a couple funded by the European Commission: Action Grid and Africa Build, with partners and experts from North and South America, Europe and Africa. For the latter, after travelling to Egypt, Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Cameroon, and Ghana, I found that they face challenges similar to those that I faced back in 1985, and which I remembered so well. However, three decades later, they can enjoy access, through any average internet connection, to a world of information thanks to the altruistic sharing of hundreds of information resources by the US National Library of Medicine. Without these and other open resources, advanced medical research and education in developing countries would be surely unaffordable and students might easily regress to the pre-internet scientific era. A different research direction, which I have taken with my colleague Professor Casimir Kulikowski, has been to analyse the scientific basis and the components that make up biomedical informatics. This has been a most unexpectedly enjoyable experience, since, when we published what we thought might be only a slightly controversial paper, critiquing the somewhat arbitrary philosophical derivation of computational ontologies, we received thirty four comments in response, ranging from those accusing us of scientific malpractice, fallaciousness, and plagiarism, among others in print, which may make me one of the most reviled critiquers in biomedical informatics history. A colleague from Boston told me once that he thought that I must enjoy this dubious merit, but my comments about the \u201cdebate\u201d were, and remains, simply, at the level of irony. However, I must admit that I found it hard to sleep for several days after reading the invective sent my way, even though I had anticipated some sharpness in responses from those relying on traditional philosophical approaches. However, as an occasional teacher of courses in the History of Science and Computer Science, how can one not remember the many arguments and disputes over the centuries, between scientists and philosophers? Fortunately, neither am I a Galileo nor they an Aristotle. Since my personal path though biomedical informatics has been difficult and personally challenging, when I have seen some of the strange directions that some in our field have taken that might damage the scientific premises of the field, I felt that they needed rebuttal. Looking towards the future, I expect to keep on working on related topics, though probably under different labels, since scientists frequently change the names of what they do in order to keep on working on the same topics! Eventually I hope to reach the stage that a well-known retired British biomedical informatician colleague has said of himself: \u201cI am no longer working on papers and projects, only on Bach and singing in a choir\u201d. So, hopefully as the soloist in the choir, though possibly still also writing, should you see my middle and second last name, Manuel Garcia, someday in a journal on the operatic singing you would not be mistaken in thinking \u201cthis is probably Victor Maojo\u201d. Currently I am a member of the editorial board of JAMIA, MIM and JBI, and an ACMI fellow. In Spain, my group twice received the award for best scientific  contributions from the Spanish Society of Health Informatics. In 1998, the society ruled that the maximum awards that could be obtained by a single group would be two. Thus, this is the number that we have when I write this, and we will have when I retire! JAMIA, 2003; 6:515-522 ", "Fernando Martin-Sanchez": "Professor, Instituto Carlos III Health Institute, Madrid Past Professor, Chair, Health Informatics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Melbourne Pre- and postdoctoral research. At the completion of my degree in molecular biology and biochemistry I conducted some experimental work in bacterial genetics in the lab of Dr. Ramon Diaz at the Centre for Biological Research (CSIC) in Madrid. I left this lab when I was selected by the company UNISYS to complete a one- year fellowship in Artificial Intelligence, at their AI research center in Madrid. I really enjoyed the time there, and became interested in informatics. I joined the Department of Artificial Intelligence at the Faculty of Informatics of the Technical University of Madrid (UPM) and started my PhD in Informatics with the aim of applying biological models to improve methods for information processing (genetic programming, artificial neural networks). In collaboration with my colleagues Professors Victor Maojo and Alejandro Pazos, we formed the Biomedical Informatics Group (GIB) in 1987, under the supervision of Professor Juan Pazos-Sierra and Fernando Alonso- Amo. Since the early years of my professional career I have been interested in the convergence between the biomedical and the information sciences. During my postdoctoral stay at the Joint Bioengineering Program between Georgia Tech and Emory University Hospital, in Atlanta, I applied Artificial Intelligence techniques from expert systems and artificial neural networks to the automatic diagnosis of heart and lung diseases from digital images obtained with nuclear magnetic resonance. As a result, our lab, led by Professors Norberto Ezquerra and Ernesto Garcia, was funded with $1M project by the NIH and later, a patent was obtained by a company providing medical imaging equipment. The paper describing this work was selected to be presented at a semi-plenary session at MEDINFO-92 (Geneva), the World Congress on Medical Informatics. That year also marked my first contact with AMIA (then SCAMC), where I attended the Spring Symposium in San Francisco and heard an eye-opening tutorial taught by Professor Douglas Brutlag from Stanford University on Artificial Intelligence applications in biomedical research. On my return to Spain I decided to prepare the first selection process to the new Higher Body of Information Systems and Technologies of the Spanish Government. More than 4000 people opted for 200 places and I concluded the selection process in the fourth position overall. This allowed me a choice of where to work, and it was the National Institute of Health Carlos III (ISCIII). In July of 1993 I became CIO of the Institute. These were years of very technically-focused work. From 1993 to 1998, we improved the infrastructure and information systems of the Institute, including digital telephony, cabling and networking of all buildings on the two campuses, and the first Internet services (Website, e-mail and Intranet), as well as introducing specific clinical systems (pharmacy, admission) for the Carlos III Hospital. My group also offered research support systems for the National Center for Epidemiology, the National School of Public Health and provided bioinformatics guidance for multiple research centers in the Majadahonda campus. The ISCIII ICT group grew from 3 to 17 people in that period.  Researcher at the National institute of Health Carlos III. In 1998, I was authorized by the Directorate of the Institute to create the Bioinformatics Unit (BIOTIC) and started working on the advanced management of genetic information in the medical domain. At this time, when the first draft of the human genome was released and the medical field began to consider the potential of molecular medicine, I clearly identified the need for closer scientific collaboration between the fields of bioinformatics and medical informatics. In 2000, I was appointed Head of the Bioinformatics and Public Health Department, which grew to a total of 17 people in 2009, as a result of obtaining funds from multiple projects from national and European agencies. In 2001, the unit had created one of the first microarray laboratories in Spain, dedicated primarily to their uses in microbiology such as the detection and identification of viruses and bacteria. The article \u201cIntegrating genomics into health information systems\u201d, published in 2002 in the journal Methods of Information in Medicine 41 (1), 25-30, of which I was the lead author, marks the beginning of my contributions to the field of Biomedical Informatics. This work, which has been cited multiple times, was the result of a presentation at the Workshop \u201cChallenges in Medical Informatics\u201d organized by the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA), which I organized in Madrid in 2001, in collaboration with the late Stephen Huesing (IMIA) and Prof. Jan Van Bemmel. I am thankful to them for giving me this opportunity. The views expressed in this Workshop were very well received by the \"ICT for Health\" Unit of the European Commission (EC), which invited me to participate in organizing the conference \u201cSynergy between Research in Medical Informatics, Bioinformatics and Neuroinformatics\u201d held in Brussels on 14 December 2001. This event was attended by more than 400 scientists and marked the beginning of the activities of the European Commission in Biomedical Informatics. I would like to acknowledge the key role that Dr. Ilias Iakovidis played during those years in promoting Biomedical Informatics research in Europe. A group of participants at this conference produced the first European R&D roadmap (BIOINFOMED Study and White Paper) on Biomedical Informatics. This work was used as input in formulating activities for the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development of the EU. The unit I was directing at the ISCIII coordinated this project. The BIOINFOMED white paper was presented at the HealthGrid (Lyon, France) conference. An abridged version was published in the Journal of Biomedical Informatics. Key contributions and constant support was received from my admired friend Professor Johan VanderLei. From 2003 to 2012, I was invited to participate in all the research roadmapping exercises conducted by the Unit \u201cICT for Health\u201d of the European Commission. These include the BIOINFOMED White Paper (2003), the HealthGrid White Paper (2004), the SYMBIOmatics project (2006), the report \u201cBeyond the Horizon\u201d (2007), the ActionGrid project (2008), and the White Paper \u201cModeling and Simulation of Human Anatomy and Physiology\u201d (2005) which marked the beginning of the initiative \u201cVirtual Physiological Human\u201d. In addition, my research activities allowed us to obtain funding for an \u2018Integrated Project\u2019 from the EU in 2002-2004. The INFOGENMED project was the first project to investigate aspects related to informatics in genomic medicine, being still part of the Fifth Framework Program. At that time, I also promoted the creation of the IMIA Working Group \u2018Informatics in Genomic Medicine\u2019.  The positive results of the BIOINFOMED study contributed greatly to the decision of the European Commission to fund 100 million Euros in order to finance research activities in Biomedical Informatics within the Sixth Framework Program (2002-2006). This effort included several projects and three Networks of Excellence, including the very successful INFOBIOMED NoE, which I sponsored, along with the IMIM in Barcelona, led by Prof. Ferran Sanz. Between 2002 and 2010, my group BIOTIC also played a key role in the development of biomedical informatics research in Spain, through the coordination and scientific leadership of two large cooperative research networks (INBIOMED, COMBIOMED). Around 2005, the growing interest of the scientific community in the issue of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology as well as the latest developments of scientific ideas about the convergence of Nano-Bio-Info-Cogno (NBIC) technologies, represented the emergence of a new field of research interest - nanoinformatics, which aimed to address the new challenges posed by nanomedicine in terms of information processing. This new area about processes at the sub-molecular level reinforced my interest in addressing the challenges of information processing across the entire spectrum of different levels and scales of organization of life and matter, from atom to population, with important potential applications in future biomedical research, particularly in precision medicine. During this period, I obtained my tenure as a research scientist and completed a PhD in Medicine (Aging and neurodegenerative disease) at the University of A Coruna, in Spain. I want to mention Dr. Concha Grau, Dr. Jose Antonio Gutierrez, and Luciano Saez, who were incredible mentors and facilitated my transition to becoming a full-time researcher. The University of Melbourne. In 2011, I received an email from my colleague and friend Marienne Hibbert, from Melbourne, informing me of a position available to which I applied. I was selected for the position of Professor and Chair of Health Informatics in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Melbourne (Australia), with the rank of department Head reporting directly to my mentor (and friend) Professor James Best, Head of the Medical School, whom I will always be in awe of for his vision, leadership and support, and also on behalf of my family. In 2013, I founded, and was appointed Director of the Health and Biomedical Informatics Research Center (HABIC) of the University. During the years 2011 to 2015 I also developed a research agenda of IBES (Institute Broadband-Enabled for a Society) in the area of Telemedicine and Aging, becoming Co-Director of this interdisciplinary institute at the University of Melbourne. Prof. Kathleen Gray, Dr Guillermo Lopez-Campos, and Claudia Sandoval played key roles in these activities and supported me during my stay in Melbourne. I explored new avenues for research in biomedical informatics, including the role of data generated by patients in Participatory Health (Quantified-Self, mobile health, evidence-based health interventions with social media, Patient-Reported Outcomes), the informatics aspects of the Exposome (the new concept that refers to the exposure of an individual to environmental factors throughout life), development of predictive models (with dynamic Bayesian networks) for clinical outcomes (e.g., length of hospital stay) using electronic medical records and administrative data. The results of this work, in collaboration with my PhD students Dr. Manal Almalki and Dr. Mark Merolli, were published in journals with the highest impact factor in the area of health informatics, such as JMIR, JAMIA, MIM or JBI. I contributed very actively to the field of Health Informatics in Australia and contributed to the success of the National Conferences HIC 2012 (Sydney) and HIC 2014 (Melbourne) as Chair of its Scientific Committee. I also successfully coordinated a new  international conference on \u2018Big Data in Health and Biomedicine\u2019 (Melbourne, April 2013), now in its fifth edition. I was a member of the Board of Australian Health Informatics Society (HISA) and was elected Fellow of the Australasian College of Health Informatics in 2011 and Fellow of the American College of Medical Informatics in 2014. I want to thank my colleagues Professors Riccardo Bellazzi and Lucila Ohno-Machado for their constant encouragement during my scientific career. Also, I co-chaired the Scientific Program Committee for the XV World Conference on Health and Biomedical Informatics, MEDINFO 2015 in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, and was keynote speaker at major international conferences including MIE 2015 (Europe), APAMI 2016 (Asia Pacific) and ITCH 2017 (Canada). At the University of Melbourne, I designed and put in place new educational courses and programs in health informatics, both at the undergraduate level (Major in Health Informatics within the Bachelor of Biomedicine) and at the Master\u2019s level one on Health IS and Health IT. I have also supervised several doctoral students in Digital Health and biomedical informatics and participated in numerous educational activities with other programs (aging, nursing, pharmacy) and continuing education for health professionals. Our research center in Melbourne developed a platform supporting translational research that included, among other tools, the REDCAP system for online clinical research questionnaires and GRHANITE system giving access to more than 2 million medical records of primary care. In addition, I was a member of the Board of Biogrid Australia, a company dedicated to the federation of patient data for research integrating more than 30 hospitals in Australia. Weill Cornell Medicine (Cornell University). As a pioneer of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, Professor Ted Shortliffe has always been a role model in my career. He and Professor Vimla Patel were so kind as to accept my invitation to participate in the official launch of HABIC in Melbourne, where I had the opportunity to learn about the plans of Weill Cornell Medicine to develop a world-class health Informatics Division. I applied for the position and, in December 2015, started as Professor of Healthcare Policy and Research, in the Faculty of Medicine of Cornell University in New York. For two years, with the leadership of Prof Rainu Kaushal, my areas of research included: digital health, participatory medicine, environmental health and precision medicine, having played an important role in several working groups from the Precision Medicine Initiative of the US government (now called All of Us Research Program). With the support of Prof Jyoti Pathak, I launched the ENaPHI Research Group (Environmental and Participatory Health Informatics) within the Department of Healthcare Policy and Research at Weill Cornell Medicine. From October 2015 to August 2017 I was Chair of the IMIA Working Group of \u201cData Mining and Big Data Analytics\u201d. Research Professor at the Institute of Health Carlos III. In July 2017, I returned to the Institute of Health Carlos III as a tenured research professor. I plan to continue the research activities of the ENaPHI group and promote nation-wide projects on big data, precision medicine and evaluation of Health IT projects. Contributing to the Institute\u2019s Master level programs on Health IT and Bioinformatics is also a priority, as well as developing the new IMIA Working Group on Exposome Informatics that I proposed and that was approved in the General Assembly held in Hangzhou at MEDINFO 2017. ", "Izet Ma\u0161i\u0107": "Professor, Founder & Head, Department of Family Medicine Founder & Head, Department of Medical Informatics University of Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herzegovina (B&H) Founder & President, Academy of Medical Sciences of B&H Founder & President, Society for Medical Informatics of B&H Even when I attended high school in Gracanica, Bosnia and Herzegovina, I showed an interest in scientific research. In 1971, I received the prestigious \u201cScience for Youth\u201d award, in the field of linguistics and history, which allowed me to organize three professional student congresses and edit two biomedical journals while studying medicine at the Medical Faculty in Sarajevo (1971-1976), I. Masic, MD, PhD, FWAAS, FIAHSI, FEFMI, FACMI one of which was distributed to all fifteen biomedical faculty members in the former Yugoslavia. My professors recognized my affinity for science, and after graduation, I was immediately hired as an assistant researcher, which provided me the opportunity to complete postgraduate studies in Social Medicine, Healthcare Organization, and Health Economics in 1978. The lecturers were renowned professors from the medical faculties in Sarajevo, Zagreb, Belgrade, Ljubljana, and among them a handful of experts from the World Health Organization. I would like to especially mention the name of my teacher and one of the pioneers of Health/Medical Informatics in the former Yugoslavia, Professor Gjuro De\u017eeli\u0107, who gave the first lectures in this field at almost all universities across the country. It did not take me long to discover and understand the importance of Medical Informatics for the everyday professional tasks of doctors, particularly in the scientific research of everyone who wants to deepen their insights in this field. Even before writing my master\u2019s thesis, \u201cEvaluation of Information System in Family Health\u201d, and my PhD thesis \u201cEvaluation of Health Information System in Primary Medical Care\u201d I decided to devote more of my time to research, because I saw all the benefits that Medical Informatics could provide to the health care system, and also how I could facilitate my daily work with it. So, I decided to start with innovations, and the first of them was to create a Family Registration Card, with a minimal data set for family practitioners, on which I tried to gather all of the data on each of my patients in one place, but as part of the family group with which the patient lived and worked, because the system of organization at that time was such that each family member obtained health care in a different segment of the health care system. This required a change of concept from a Paper Based Information System to introduce an Electronic Based Information System. This endeavor was challenging, expensive, and laborious, especially because there was a lot of resistance from the decision-makers to any changes in the existing system, which would require new financial investments. Medical informatics experiences: With the experience I gained by reading articles and books in the field of Medical Informatics, during a residency in Social Medicine, Health Care Organization and Economics, which also deals with this important sub-field, I went to the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and attended six months of courses in Health Statistics and Informatics. There I had the opportunity to learn for the first time the programming languages Cobol, Fortran, Pascal, and how to  use the PDP computers newly introduced into practice. My interest, love, and more serious involvement in Health Informatics began at the LSHTM. I already knew of the famous Spectrum micro-computer made by Sir Clive Sinclair, and its programming language BASIC, and the invention of the QL minicomputer, so that in Sarejevo in 1982, I became the first person in the East to use it, with the first project and master\u2019s thesis. As part of the project \u201cContent of Doctors\u2019 Work in the Family and the Local Community\u201d, in addition to regular work at the clinic with patients, I collected and processed data from paper forms/data elements into the variables that I personally created and processed on the QL computer in the programming language Archive and developed various forms of reports for the management of the Health Center. I labeled some of the patients as a separate sample with a bar code and monitored them for a certain period, and the variables that I had defined were correlated and used to output information for analyzing the health status of my patients and for planning and programming medical team activities in terms of the organization of quality, rational, and cost-effective health care. At the same time, I led the Republic\u2019s Commission for the Health Information System that was organized to determine and monitor the implementation of the Unified Health Information System for Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1985 to 2000. The above project introduced a local information system for healthcare centers, pharmacies, and clinical information systems modeled on the then-current Health Information Systems used in Europe and other parts of the world. Only the HIS of the University Clinical Centre in Sarajevo during this period had the ability to draw on a multi-disciplinary team of designers and experts in Medical Informatics, which were under the patronage of the giant Energoinvest Sarajevo. Its IRIS department performed the studies and detailed project planning for the development of an HIS for the Clinical Centre in Sarajevo. About 900,000 euros (in today\u2019s terms) were allocated in 1990, which bought a modern Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) computer system, worth around 700,000 euros at the time. Unfortunately, the war in the Balkans, and specifically the especially brutal and horrifying war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, interrupted the implementation of the project, which was never completed according to the timeline which was put forth in the study and the main project. However, in the post-war period, new projects were adapted, and built on these plans, though unfortunately, they never came close to covering those segments of healthcare in Sarajevo and in other cities of Bosnia and Herzegovina as had been originally projected in the Strategic Plan of 1985. Today, the use of local information systems, for specific organizational schemes of health, is comprised of two entities covering the 10 cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, while there is still no link between these systems at the national level. My other activities were more directly related to the introduction and implementation of Medical informatics itself. In 1992, I founded the first Department of Medical Informatics at the Medical Faculty in Sarajevo, teaching lectures at the Faculty of Dental Medicine, Faculty of Pharmacy, and the High Medical School of the University of Sarajevo. Later, other, independent departments were formed within these Faculties and the other five universities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but the curricula of the subsequently-formed departments were the same or similar to the one at the Sarajevo Medical Faculty, because their textbooks were based on my teaching materials (textbooks and practicum) which I wrote with fellow doctors and which would later be published in English and recognized across Europe and globally, running to several editions. Through our academic cathedratic organization in Sarajevo, we have developed many projects within the Medical Informatics field organizing workshops and conferences. The main project I led was \u201cIntroduction to Distance Learning in Medical  Curriculum\u201d, under a grant of the Cantonal and Federal Ministry of Science and Education in the period 2002-2007. It was the first project of Web Based Learning in South-Eastern Europe in biomedicine. In 2004, I organized the first tele-lecture at the University of Sarajevo (Rolf Engelbrecht gave a lecture via Messenger from Munich), and in 2005, I organized the first tele-exam between Podgorica (Montenegro) and Sarajevo (Bosnia and Herzegovina), transmitted by TV stations in Sarajevo. In 1993, I also started publishing a journal covering the scope of Medical Informatics - Acta Informatica Medica (www.actainformmed.org), which is today an international journal indexed in over 20 online databases (PubMed, PubMed Central, Scopus, Embase, etc.). In 1987, together with a group of enthusiasts interested in the field of Medical Informatics, I founded the Society for Medical Informatics, and then together with colleagues from Zagreb, Belgrade, and Ljubljana, we united with the Yugoslav Association of Medical Informatics (YAMI). So in 1990 in Belgrade, we organized the First Congress of Medical Informatics of Yugoslavia, and that same year YAMI joined EFMI as a full member. Professional Activities: Unfortunately, the tragic events of the war and their consequent disruptions of \u201cnormal\u201d life halted all activities of this Association at the domestic and international level. However, during the war, and after the independence of their respective nations, the Croatian, Slovenian, and Bosnian-Herzegovinian associations joined EFMI and IMIA. I was personally involved with the Bosnian and Herzegovinian Society (BHSMI) in EFMI in March 1994 at MIE\u201994 in Lisbon and with the IMIA in September 1994 at the IMIA GA in Dresden. BHSMI organized over 20 conferences, most with international participation. From 1994 to the present, I have been a regular member of the IMIA and EFMI Council and General Assembly, and at the majority of meetings I have actively participated as member of the Scientific Program Committee, author of articles, chair of scientific sessions and workshops, etc. I have also contributed to the work and success of both associations to the extent I could, and with the opportunities that I have had. The greatest achievement was the organization of the 22nd European Congress of Medical Informatics in Sarajevo in August 2009, which is still referred to as one of the best-organized MIE Conferences of all times. Other academic and professional positions that I hold, awards received, and events I have participated in include: Professor of Management Quality of Health at Dubrovnik International University (DIU), Health Management at Faculty of Health Sciences of University of Zenica; Editor-in-chief of biomedical journals (\u201cGlas medicinara\u201d, \u201cActa Medica et Stomatologica Studentorum Iugoslavica\u201d, \u201cMedical Archives\u201d, Acta Informatica Medica\u201d, \u201cMateria Socio-Medica\u201d, \u201cEuropean Journal for Biomedical Informatics\u201d. I had founded the Society for Medical Informatics in B&H in 1988. In the year 2009 I organized the Academy of Medical Sciences of B&H. I have been a member of the EFMI Council (1994-present), General Assembly of IMIA (1994- present), International Society for Telemedicine & eHealth (2005-present), European Association for Public Health (EUPHA) (2000-present), and European Association of Information Technology Managers (2007-2015). From 2012 to 2015 I was a member of the Council of the European Association of Science Editors (EASE). I have organized over 50 scientific and professional conferences with 10 of these during the war in Sarajevo (1992-95). I chaired the MIE2009 Conference in Sarajevo in August, 2019. I have organized two SWEP (Mediterranean Seminar on Science Writing, Editing and Publishing) in Sarajevo in 2016 and 2018. I have been elected as Honorary Fellow of EFMI (FEFMI) at the Council meeting held in Munich during the MIE 2016 Conference,  and a Fellow of the American College of Medical Informatics in 2016 (FACMI). I have been elected a Founding member of the International Academy of Health Sciences Informatics (IAHSI) in 2017 and a member of World Academy of Art and Science in 2019 (WAAS). In particular, three of my books have become notably cited: \u201cMedical Informatics\u201d (2010), \u201cContributions to the History of Medical Informatics\u201d (2014) and the \u201cBiographical Lexicon of Medical Informatics\u201d (2015), which can now be found in university libraries throughout Europe and worldwide. Details about the events and accomplishments mentioned here that go beyond the limits of what can be considered my \u201cpersonal story\u201d can be found on my website www.imasic.org. With this personal essay I can, with joy that fills my heart and soul, conclude with the statement that I am happy to have lived and spent almost all of my professional life in the field of medical informatics, in addition to my other medical obligations and activities, contributing with my knowledge, experience, and all sorts of activities to the spread of ideas and knowledge that has been transmitted to us by our medical informatics pioneers of years past. Opening Ceremony of the MIE 2009 Conference, Sarajevo, 2009 ", "Oleg Yu. Mayorov": "Professor & Head, Department of the Clinical Informatics Kharkiv Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education, UACM Senior Vice President, Editor-in-Chief, J. Clinical Informatics and Telemedicine Past Chief Medical Informatician of Ukraine, Ministry of Healthcare During my student years, I became interested in neuroscience, being most attracted to objective quantitative methods of brain research and, in particular, to electroencephalography (EEG). My first scientific research involved the analysis of the asymmetry of ascending and descending fronts of the alpha rhythm of EEGs during my fourth year at the Neurological Department of the Kharkiv National Medical University under the supervision of Prof. Petr V. Voloshin (1967). My PhD dissertation at the Institute of Children and Adolescent Health Protection of the National Academy of Medical Sciences (ICAHP) was supervised (1969-73) by the renowned neurophysiologist Professor Fedor P. Vedyaev. I investigated the bioelectrical activity of the limbic system structures during development through stereotactic depth from EEG. Earlier visual analyses of EEG simply estimated the duration of epileptiform activity and discharge after-effect from the post-electric stimulation of different limbic structures, with concomitant behavioral and vegetative reactions. After completing my PhD, I tried to relate my correlation EEG analyses with methods proposed by Norbert Wiener in 1950, later applied to EEG by Mary A. Brazier and James U. Casby (1951). Lacking large digital computers, I built an analog correlograph with a\u201cMN-10m\u201d computer, similar to that proposed by John S. Barlow (1961), having a delay unit and special magnetographs for low-frequency signal recording. Its processing time was slow. From 1976 to 1989 we progressively improved our analyses using high-performance small computers (\u201cNairi K\u201d, \u201cCCS-CM-2M\u201d), and finally the large EC1060 third- generation computer\u2014supported by ICAHP Director Professor Aleksandra I. Kornilova. Correlation and spectral analyses did not adequately quantitatively estimate the degree of functional organization (cognitive functions, integration and synchronization) of the brain structures as a system. With yet more powerful computers, together with mathematician Anatoly B. Glukhov, PhD, we developed novel advanced EEG and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) methods, technologies, and algorithms selecting key parameters for digital spectral analyses of EEG patterns based on the estimation of likely errors and algorithms for identifying pathological activity in \u201con-line\u201d and \u201coff-line\u201d mode for 24- hour monitoring of epilepsy patients. In 1978, our work reached a key stage: multivariate linear systems analyses based on EEG data from different brain structures yielded physiological interpretations for newly derived mathematical parameters, enabling detailed identification of multivariate cerebral function with complex structures representing a core of the central architecture of functional systems. It provided a quantitative estimate of the \u201clevel of systematicity\u201d, the ability to \u201cblock\u201d influences of one group of cerebral structures from another, and a quantitative estimate of functional asymmetry of hemispheres (lateralization and interference), as well as \u201ccontribution\u201d of each structure to overall system activity. My D.Sc. dissertation used this in rat experiments with stereotactic implanted electrodes in  cortical and subcortical brain structures, studying the central mechanisms of emotional stress resistance. In 2001, with mathematicians A. B. Glukhov, A. B. Prognimak, V. N. Fenchenko, with Markus Fritzche, MD, PhD (Switzerland), we developed algorithms based on nonlinear models of deterministic chaos for analyzing the neurodynamics of EEG in schizophrenia patients. Novel results included: determination of the \u201cdelay time\u201d on the basis of the offset method using estimates of the size of axes of attractors reconstructed in the phase space by one-dimensional models of dynamic brain structure; Karhunen\u2013 Lo\u00e8ve expansion for analysis of spatio-temporal patterns of EEGs; modification of known algorithms for reconstructing chaos parameters with significantly increased accuracy and reliability of estimated attractor parameters from the EEG data (based on artifact-free stationary components of the EEG), \u201cchannels and jokers\u201d methods for bioelectrical brain activity; multifractal analyses for EEG; and a method of automatic computation of the correlation dimension and correlation entropy of biological signals. In 2009, we developed a new method combining multivariate linear analysis and multidimensional nonlinear EEG analysis. At the first stage, in each of the ranges (\u03b4, \u03b8, \u03b1, \u03b21, \u03b2, \u03b3), multivariate spectral analysis of the EEG of all leads reveals groups of brain formations involved in integrative activity. Then, in each range for each identified group, based on the EEG of the structures forming this group, one \u201cprincipal\u201d signal is generated. This signal is subjected to non-linear analysis, which allows us to evaluate the nature of the neurodynamics of the identified cerebral systems. We designed algorithms for Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis that detect R- peaks waves in animals behaving freely, where distortion of the shape of the ECG is typical. These algorithms were applied to toddlers and children of different ages, and patients with mental disorders, whose E\u0421Gs often evidence artifacts and distortions due to their movement. We also came up with new methods for HRV analysis: global reconstruction of Heart Rate Variability dynamic systems using relatively few cardio intervals, application of the local index of fractality in the analysis of short RR interval series, among others. We developed PC-based diagnostic systems incorporated into the computerized \u00ae qEEG and qHRV systems NeuroResearcher Innovation Suite&Cardio-Tension-Test\u00ae (1984 - 2019). Software packages implemented not only classical methods of EEG analysis, but also multivariate spectral and nonlinear EEG analyses, and it was used for research in rat experiments with stereotactic implanted electrodes. These computerized qEEG and qHRV systems showed high efficacy in studies of the healthy brain, mechanisms during acute and chronic emotional stress; in patients with schizophrenia, depression, neurosis, diabetes, tension-type headache, minimally conscious state with cranium cerebral injury, congenital and acquired eyesight defects and anxious-phobic disorders. Around this time, I participated in a project teaching doctors how to apply complex mathematical methods for quantitative EEG analysis and developed the \u201cVirtual \u00ae constructor \u2013 EEG designer\u201d, which is a component of our qEEG NeuroResearcher th system, currently in its 18 version. Awards. I was awarded an academician P.K. Anokhin medal of the Normal Physiology Institute Academy of Medical Sciences of the USSR, for development of \u201cTheories of functional systems\u201d (1991); the Leonard Euler medal of Europaische Akademie der Naturwissenchaften, Germany (2008) for outstanding contributions in creating new medical information technologies; and the Gold Medal of the Ukrainian Professional League of Psychiatrists for effective neurodiagnostic EEG technologies (2018).  I presented many papers at international congresses and symposia and was invited to universities and institutes to lecture on our new approaches to EEG analysis. These included: the US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), whose department Head, the nobelist Daniel C. Gajdusek, visited my laboratory in Kharkiv, in 2002; the Division of Clinical Immunopathology at the University of Pittsburgh; the National Institute on Aging (NIA); the State University of NY at Buffalo; the University of Southern Alabama; the Georg-August-University in G\u00f6ttingen, where I was invited by Dr. Otto Rienhoff; the Federal Technical University of Switzerland; and the University of Zurich. th After the collapse of the USSR and Ukrainian independence, the IV Congress of the World Federation of Ukrainian Medical Associations took place in Kharkiv in 1992. Doctors, emigres, ethnic Ukrainians from other European countries, the USA and Australia all participated in this Congress. I was a Vice-Chairman of the Local Organizing Committee and proposed that the Ukrainian Association for Computer Medicine (UACM), be formed, supported by the President of the Ukrainian Medical Association Professor Lubomir Perig and the US geneticist Professor Wolodimir Wertelecki. I was elected Senior Vice President and CEO at the inaugural meeting, while Professor Victor M. Ponomarenko, Deputy Minister of Health, became UACM President. Since then I have been engaged in these activities at the level of the Ministry of Health. In 1993, I took part in the General Assembly of IMIA in Kyoto, where, supported by Dr. Marion J. Ball, the UACM became a national member of IMIA, followed the next year as national member of EFMI. I became the representative of Ukraine in these organizations. We obtained sponsorship support from a number of institutions and individuals. Peter McNair financially supported the participation of the Ukrainian delegation at MIE-96 in Copenhagen. Professor Bernard Richards and Nettie de Glanville sponsored Ukrainian delegations to the Harrogate Conferences in 1994, 1995, 1996, and Dr. Ralf Engelbrecht supported the participation of the Ukrainian delegation at MIE -2000 in Hannover. I became Chief Medical Informatician of the Ukraine from 1999 to 2007. This was a first for the Ukraine, and also a first in any of the lands of the former USSR, focusing on the creation of a regulatory health informatics database and the informatization of medical institutions. We have prepared a number of regulatory documents: Concepts of Health Informatization of Ukraine; Sectoral Program and the Project of Informatization for 2013-2018 (I was Scientific Director of the Program); a co-author of the Law of Ukraine \u201cOn the Principles of State Policy of Public Health\u201d (2015-2016) under revision by Parliament following approval by the Health Committee. Other documents that I co- authored include \u201cRules on the Certification of Information Technologies in Healthcare\u201d; \u201cRoles on the Chief Medical Informatician of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine and Regions\u201d; and specifically regarding medicine, \u201cQualifications for PhD or D.Sc. in Biological and Medical Cybernetics and Informatics\u201d. At my initiative, the Ministry set up the Coordinating Council on Informatization (2006 and 2012) (of which I was Vice- Chair) and the Committee on Certification of Medical Information Technologies (2000) (also serving as Vice-Chair). From 1996 to 2010, I was a Chair of the Consolidated Commission on \u201cTelemedicine\u201d of the Ministry of Health and NAMS of Ukraine which collaborated with the International Telecommunication Union of the WHO (ITU) and the European Commission on Telemedicine (DGXIII). In 1996, I set up and became Editor of the UACM Web-portal in three languages (http://uacm.kharkov.ua/eng/). From 1998 till 2006, a Ukrainian \u201cmirror\u201d server of the European Health Telematics  Observatory (EHTO) was in operation, and I was a member of the Strategic Board of Directors of the EHTO servers in national languages at the invitation of the EHTO Founder and Chair, Maria Laires, PhD (Portugal). In 1997, under my leadership, the Department of Healthcare Informatization in the Ukrainian Institute of Public Health (now the Ukrainian Institute of Strategic Studies of the Ministry of Health) was set up, where I was the Principal Scientist (part-time). The first study dealt with analysis of world experiences in the implementation of HIS, and the advantages and disadvantages of systems produces by well-known American and European manufacturers. As a result of this study, we launched a project \u201cHospital Information Systems of Ukraine\u201d. Since 2001, I have been working on the creation and implementation of HISs. Under my supervision, we designed a fully functional HIS \u00ae (Institute-Mi&T@Clinic ), which incorporates a post-relational database, electronic signature, and personal data protection. The system is designed to work under the conditions of insurance medicine. In 2013 \u2013 2014, I participated in international projects, such as becoming the main Ukrainian coordinator for the worldwide EMR Systems Study at Harvard University; and in 2015, as an expert in the Third Global Survey on eHealth, WHO 2015, on the use of eHealth in support of universal health coverage. I\u2019m also involved as an international expert advising on projects and scientific publications: from 1997 as an expert of the European Commission on Telemedicine (DGXIII); and also from 1997 until the present \u2013 as European Expert (Reviewer) of MIE at the Special Topic Conferences (STC) and World (IMIA) Congresses on Medical Informatics. In 2016, I participated as an expert in the mission of the WHO Office in collaboration with the World Bank to support the Ministry of Health on \u201cAssistance in developing a coordinated action plan to strengthen the medical information and eHealth project in Ukraine.\u201d For activities on health informatization, I have received two Honorary Diplomas from the Minister of Health and an Honorary Diploma from the Presidium of the National Academy of Medical Sciences. In 2003, I was among the founders and I\u2019m now the Editor-in-Chief of the multidisciplinary journal Clinical Informatics and Telemedicine. I\u2019m a member of the editorial boards of nine professional journals including \u201cThe European Journal of Biomedical Informatics (EJBI)\u201d and am author of more than 300 scientific publications. Medical teaching. In 1995, with the support of Rector Prof. Nykolay I. Khvisyuk, I organized the first Department of Clinical Informatics and IT in Healthcare Management at the KhMAPE (Kharkiv Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education) and serve as its Head. Doctors with different specializations, interns, master\u2019s degrees, postgraduate students, and medical managers take postgraduate advanced training courses in our department. I have co-authored two textbooks: Healthcare management and Information technologies in medical management. Under my scientific supervision, 8 PhD and D.Sc. dissertations have been successfully awarded. I am also a co-author of the Unified Program of the postgraduate education for physicians and pharmacists (Kiev, 2012). Since 2016, I\u2019ve been a member of the Committee on Standards in Medical Education of the Ministry of Education and Science. I was a member of the experts Council for Medical and Biological Problems of the Higher Attestation Commission and was in charge of awarding of PhD and D.Sc. degrees (1994-1999, 2006-2010). ", "Jytte Brender McNair": "Assoc. Professor Emeritus, Aalborg University, Department of Health Science and Technology (since 2011) How did I start in Health Informatics? My background in medical informatics started with my graduation as a M.Sc. in biochemistry in 1973. Three months into my job at the University Hospital at Hvidovre, where my obligations included a combination of analytical biochemistry and research in protein chemistry, I was also tasked to provide a parametrisation of all the J.B. McNair, MSc, PhD analytical procedures for the purpose of the ongoing design of a custom-designed Laboratory Information System (LIS), for which the User Requirements were being prepared for a Call for Tender. I participated in one meeting and came with one small bright idea, which resulted in being headhunted as one of two user representatives for the rest of the design, implementation, installation, and operation project. Being up against three professional IT-consultants and organisational consultants plus later the LIS vendor\u2019s staff also, I decided to attend courses in computer science at Copenhagen University in my spare time. That indeed helped me tremendously. The systems development process was challenging, inspiring and with rewarding personal relationships. After a year of the system\u2019s operating routinely in the laboratory, I returned to biochemical research and at the same time my boss encouraged me to do research projects on the LIS as a compensation for the many years spent on the systems development work. The result was two major projects, of which one later was elaborated to become my master thesis on the topic of \u201cquality management \u2013 how does a user (organisation) secure that they get what they want?\u201d. Meanwhile, I was beginning to realise that the way my brain works complies better with the abstract thinking in systems modelling than the practical and experimental biochemical research. In parallel, Peter McNair and I had been colleagues in the laboratory for 5 years with neighbouring offices without really getting to talk together, simply because of diverging tasks. When our boss gave us one shared task, we realised how well all of our personal and professional values were aligned, resulting in a long friendship, and our marriage five years later. An interim result was the development of an idea for a project, which I used in a job application for a position as a full-time researcher in Denmark\u2019s largest systems & software company, Computer Resources International A/S. I got the job, and it resulted in the KAVAS Project in the AIM Programme under the EU Fourth Framework Programme. And, from there on to one EU R&D project after another until early retirement as emerita associate professor in 2011, when I no longer could find the funds to do what I really wanted to do. My research throughout these EU projects, covering a total of almost three decades, had a scientific focus on various theoretical and practical aspects of Quality Management and Technology Assessment that included all aspects of evaluation and quality & risk management, ranging from constructive evaluation (dynamic, self-reflective, purpose- driven and corrective evaluation), to holistic analysis of organisational and behavioural  aspects. Almost all of my projects have bridged healthcare (including biochemistry) and informatics\u2014that is, health informatics. My experience covers the breadth of organisational change and evolution, covers theoretical aspects, the quality of semantic aspects, and interoperability of medical knowledge, and even further to the modelling of the architectural logic of organisations. As a computer scientist at the anthropocentric end of the \u2018scale\u2019, all things human-centred interest me as does the multifaceted realm of asymmetric abstraction. A major publication resulting from this multifaceted work is a handbook of methods for constructive evaluation of IT-based solutions, emphasising the hidden aspects of methods, assumptions for application, conjectures on their epistemological nature, as well as potential pitfalls and perils leading to bias. It includes a framework for meta- analysis of evaluation studies that is dedicated to pinpointing the downsides in such studies, while scrutinizing experimental biases. My research took another, yet slighter turn ten years ago, and that was why I chose early retirement in 2011, when there were no funds to do what I wanted and had to do. I had earlier had a visitation where I was told my mission in life, and in the years following I slowly realised the consequence of what it meant. The short version of the story of what happened is that three years after the visitation I met an American woman, who has had a total of three Near-Death-Experiences; the essence of that story is that she each time saw a dynamic geometric structure when she was clinically dead. That structure has been modelled in detail by means of computer simulation (see www.rwgrayprojects.com, under \u201cHow the universe works\u201d) and then translated into a template information model. Now, as Lou Kauffman, professor of mathematics, University of Illinois, Chicago, expressed it in our book on the Mereon Matrix: \u201cFor whatever Mereon really is, she is our link with the creative process at the heart of the universe.\u201d. Over the years, I have had so many dreams and messages in simple meditations as well as synchronicities in my everyday life, pointing me and my work in this direction, so that there cannot be any doubt left. Peter and I used that template model for modelling the immensely complex domain of human molecular genetics. I continued this work with the modelling of a single niche in more detail, biological evolution \u2013 about 200 years after Lamarck and 150 years after Darwin; and like Bohr and Einstein, they are not contradictory, they are two sides of one coin. In short, my mission is to bring about that structure, and with my professional background I can do that as an informatics researcher by applying the template information model, striving to understand the internal workings of systems as systems, therein both social and biological systems. This unites all of the accumulated knowledge and experiences from my three academic degrees and from all of the R&D projects that I have participated in. My next projects are related to the continued information modelling of general systems theory and molecular genetics while striving to understand how we develop \u2018acquired chronic diseases\u2019, simply by means of information modelling. I have no doubt that this can be explained by means of the Mereon Matrix template information model, but it will take a number of years more to get there. ", "Peter McNair": "Executive Officer, EFMI (1998-2002) Director, Health Informatics Unit, Capital Region, Denmark (2006- 2007), Director, Medical Genetics Laboratory at the National Research Centre, Kennedy Centre, Denmark (2007-2011) My way into Health Informatics My way into health informatics has its roots in a highly computerised medical specialty, clinical biochemistry, also called chemical pathology. The department where I got a position as registrar in 1980 had a fully automated Laboratory Information System (LIS) in operation in 1979 covering the range from on-line P. McNair, Dr Med.Sci, MD ordering (a CPOE) over the laboratory production with its quality management to the delivery of electronic reports to the clinicians. However, besides these two things paved my way into health informatics: 1) a strong interest in statistics resulted in the development of an almost full statistical package on a Commodore 64 at the beginning of the 1980\u2019s, before statistical packages like SAS and SPSS were available for complex statistical analysis, simply because of lack of the necessary tools for my colleagues\u2019 and my own clinical research. 2) My cooperation with Jytte Brender, a colleague of mine in the department at that time, since the mid 1980\u2019s; together, we had (and still have) an amazing ability to brainstorm on innovative ideas and projects. The latter resulted in the KAVAS AIM project under the Fourth Framework Programme, and over the following two decades or more, a series of other EU R&D health informatics projects, ending with PSIP. In parallel, I was\u2014as head of the department\u2014responsible for the operation and maintenance of LIS. Meanwhile, I was president of the congress MIE\u201996 with Jytte as my right hand and secretary. The congress was from a professional perspective a success and I think it was supportive in bridging subsequent MIE congresses into the Information Age thanks to the engagement of the highly motivated people in our Local Organising Committee. In 2004, I was headhunted as project manager for the task of eliciting the clinical knowledge for a huge electronic healthcare record under development, meant to cover all 26 medical specialties in 14 hospitals of the Copenhagen Region. Before that was finished, I was headhunted as director of the Health Informatics Unit at the newly formed Capital Region of Denmark, which was to implement a major organisational restructuring project where 3 counties with very divergent professional cultures were merged into one region. For this purpose, I chose to apply the framework later published in the book mentioned by Jytte Brender\u2014and it worked!! However, I did not thrive in this very stressful and political environment bridging between divergent agendas covering a hospital sector with its 14 major hospitals and a GP sector with 1.6 million inhabitants and its political governance. So, I quickly chose to go back to my original profession as a laboratory director and got a position at the research laboratory for clinical genetics at the Kennedy Center here in Copenhagen; this time, with the first and major task to manage the implementation of a LIS and preparing an IT-strategy for the entire center as well as achieving the first Danish ISO 15189 accreditation of a Clinical  Genetics laboratory. In parallel, I continued my research work in one final EU R&D project, namely PSIP. When PSIP finished in 2011, I went on early retirement. The change from clinical biochemistry to clinical genetics\u2014because I needed to understand the domain, not just being a manager\u2014resulted in cognitive problems. Clinical genetics is so based on operational knowledge, while I prefer to operate in terms of models. And therefore, I asked Jytte whether she could make a model of the domain of clinical genetics. She started slowly in 2008, but it was only when we both took early retirement in 2011 that we got the time to complete this information modelling endeavour, resulting in some 160 pages entitled \u201cThe Mereon Matrix \u2013 Unity, Perspective and Paradox\u201d (2013), which gave a tremendous overview of human molecular genetics. In hindsight, the power in abstract modelling of informatics has been a tremendously valuable tool for me in understanding and conquering new specialty knowledge domains in health care some 5 times during my career. ", "George I. Mihalas": "Professor of Medical Informatics, Biostatistics and Biophysics Victor Babes University of Medicine & Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania Member, Romanian Academy of Medical Sciences Past President EFMI, Vice-chair IMIA History WG FEFMI, FIAHSI, EFMI Honorary Fellow Pioneering years in Medical Informatics Romania had little scientific contact with the Western world until 1968 when, having not joined the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, it began to receive invitations from Western countries for scientific exchange. I was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to spend an entire academic year in America, at Virginia Commonwealth University. As a young biophysicist, I was advised by the head of my department to specialize in the use of ion-selective electrodes, which were just emerging and being tested in experimental medical research in the Gastroenterology department of the Medical College. My adviser, professor Edward Moore, asked me to process the experimental results (mostly from dose-response in vivo studies on dogs), using their computer facility\u2014an Olivetti 101, programmable in machine code! I developed programs for linear regression, and later for parametric analysis of pharmacodynamic data in parallel with models for a double-site receptor for gastrin. We realized we needed more powerful computer facilities, so the lab rented a terminal connected by phone line to an IBM-370, to develop APL programs. Returning to Romania, I collaborated with departments of physiology and pharmacology in data processing, for which I had to rewrite the programs in Fortran for an IBM-360 at the Polytechnic University, using punched cards for both programs and data. In 1976, I started my first clinical application\u2014a database (in Cobol) for a study of diabetic patients, for which we also developed an initial version of an electronic health record. We presented it at the first National Symposium of Medical Informatics (1977, Satu-Mare) and at a meeting in our university, which yielded unexpected success\u2014 several clinics decided to try to develop similar databases. This was also key in getting official support for acquiring a computer, with a magnetic tape unit and two 8-inch floppy disk units! I had to first develop a library of statistical programs (mostly in Basic), then organize a \u201cservice\u201d for data processing for all my colleagues from the university, which turned into organizing some courses about computer uses in data processing. The applications were not limited to statistical analysis, but included also pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, acid-base equilibrium, and even signal processing (initially using data from manually sampled recorded EEG signals and later an analog-to-digital converter built by colleagues from Polytechnic University). Subsequently, I developed a direct Fourier transform and later an FFT program for spectral analysis. Meanwhile, I also continued the experimental studies on biophysics of gastric acid secretion, but in vitro, building an Ussing-Zerahn device for studies of epithelial membranes, and worked hard to develop an acquisition system to collect the data and to monitor these experiments. This was finally possible using a process computer (EcaRom). There were several technical difficulties, since the system of electrodes could interfere, hence it was necessary to separate the circuits using optical techniques.  The rapid increase and large variety of computer applications in medical research and practice reflected the emergence of a new discipline\u2014medical informatics, a discipline which was still missing from the basic curriculum of medical students. Hence, I made a proposal to our rector to introduce such a discipline. My proposal survived several bureaucratic traps and was approved; so, in 1984 our university became the first Romanian university to offer such a course. It was optional, but my lab filled up with students from early morning until late at night. It was not easy to prepare my course. We had less and less access to foreign journals\u2014one of the many wrong ideas of Ceausescu (Romania\u2019s president, leading a strong totalitarian communist regime by then). Fortunately, I met a very generous person, Professor Peter van Leuven from the University of Herdeke in Germany, who used to send me weekly xeroxed copies of selected pages from Current Contents, including the addresses of the authors. This way, I could send requests for articles. The rate of answers, however, proved quite low, even when I mentioned I couldn\u2019t access the original journal without specifying why not. (I think that most people in the Western world either did not care or could not even imagine such a situation). However, I did receive some positive replies from leaders in the field such as Jan van Bemmel, from the Vrije University of Amsterdam (later at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam). He not only sent me the requested article, but also another set of some ten articles about medical informatics education and teaching. As a result, I was able to start \u201cmedical informatics education in Romania\u201d following the highest European standards and, even though I did not have programs for all potential applications, for most of them my students could enjoy \u201chands-on\u201d classes. Unfortunately, not all medical universities in Romania could introduce this course, which actually only became mandatory for all medical students in Romania after 1990. During the same period of the early 1980\u2019s, I started a collaboration with Professor Zeno Simon, an outstanding physico-chemist and biophysicist, interested in drug design and protein synthesis genetic control. Together, we developed several mathematical models and computer simulation programs. The most interesting finding was that some regulatory systems (like p53-mdm2) do not reach a steady state under certain conditions but display oscillatory behaviors. Studia Biophysica and the Journal of Systems Biology published our work. These oscillations were also later observed experimentally. Nationally, the National Center for Health Informatics, Statistics and Medical Documentation of the Ministry of Health (MoH), organized a series of lectures on medical informatics especially for the staff of the medical authorities, leading to the publication of the first Romanian handbook of Medical Informatics in 1988, which was awarded the Prize \u201cGheorghe Marinescu\u201d by the Romanian Academy. After 1990, the laboratory of medical informatics of the department of biophysics became a stand-alone department. Our annual national meetings of medical informatics, which started in 1977, and their participants founded the Romanian Society of Medical Informatics\u2014RSMI. Our discipline became better known and collaborated with other departments and institutions. My proposal for a PhD degree program was approved in 1991, and I became the first Romanian PhD coordinator for the specialty of Medical Informatics and Biostatistics. After the collapse of the communist regime in Eastern Europe, we enhanced our contacts with similar groups in other countries, and my students were able to work in other laboratories as well\u2014it was a most hopeful and enthusiastic period, good for raising the scientific level of our work, though we lost several good students who found better positions abroad! In 1994, the Romanian Society for Medical Informatics became a member of IMIA (at the General Assembly in Dresden) and of EFMI (at the Council Meeting in Lisbon).  International cooperation became a common thing, with very good contacts with the British Computer Society \u2013 Health Group, resulting in several visits to Romania by Graham Wright, Helen Betts, Jean Roberts, and Bernard Richards. Support came also from other organizations and persons such as the National Library of Medicine\u2014when Richard Hsieh invited several Eastern Europeans to a Symposium in Geneva for Medinfo\u201992, while Peter McNair obtained financial support for about 20 people for attending MIE\u201996 in Copenhagen, and Bernard Richards helped over 40 people to attend Harrogate Conferences in 1996-8, Jana Zvarova offered support for attending the courses organized by EuroMISE in Prague, and Rolf Engelbrecht got around 30 bursaries for MIE\u20192000 in Hannover. Marion Ball, John Bryan, and Assa Reichert also provided support. In 1996, Marcelo Sosa Iudicissa formed an EFMI Working Group on \u201cMedical Informatics In Countries In Transition\u201d (MICIT); I was elected co-chair and became chair when Marcelo Sosa moved to the European Parliament. I was also elected a member of IMIA\u2019s Nomination Committee, chaired by Hans Petersen. In 2001, I was asked to take over the leadership of the National Center for Health Informatics, Statistics and Medical Documentation, and become its CEO. A very large Health Information Management System needed to be completed, but having exceeded its budget, with only a couple of functional components I was asked to to find out what had happened. The project had started in 1996 to build an information network linking the health authorities of the 41 districts of Romania with MoH for operative reporting through a network connecting all health units: hospitals and family physicians. When bureaucratic delays resulted in no equipment being procured until 1998, the restrictive rules of the World Bank prevented updating equipment procurement, while changing software was even more problematic. Meanwhile, the very structure of the healthcare system in Romania changed. When the National Health Insurance House (NHIH) took over several tasks from MoH, instead of finding a solution for exchanging information between the two central institutions, physicians were obliged to send separate reports to the healthcare system and to the insurance system. One of the objectives I included in my plan was to reach a consensus to reduce the bureaucratic load on physicians and find practical solutions to share the information from their reports between MoH, NHIH, and the College of Physicians. Unfortunately, without the support from NHIH this did not happen. Later I found out that they had in store a much larger project (with a 5 times larger budget) for a national health information system, which became a reality around 2010 under the name SIUI\u2014\u201cSistem Informatic Unic Integrat\u201d. This experience made me pay more attention to the need to develop realistic and sustainable strategies for large- scale health information systems, attending to all potential subjective and objective barriers to implementation, so as to encourage adoption of medical informatics standards and build an appropriate legislative framework for implementation, including features related to data security. My year in Bucharest at MoH also provided me the opportunity to organize the first EFMI Special Topic Conference\u2014STC 2001 there, suggested by Rolf Engelbrecht, the EFMI president. The topic \u201cHealthcare Telematic Support in Countries in Transition\u201d was attractive, and we had a very good audience, including industry \u2013 private companies. The success of the conference probably led to my being elected EFMI secretary in 2001, at the Council Meeting in London during MEDINFO 2001. In the same year, I became chair of the \u201cHealth Informatics for Development\u201d WG of IMIA, succeeding Nora Olivieri. I ended my stay in Bucharest after one year as general manager of the unit, when I realized I did not have enough political support and my propositions had no chance of being seriously considered\u2014so I returned to my students in Timisoara, still thinking that  the socio-political context should be more deeply explored through a historical approach to our domain. As the only PhD coordinator in medical informatics in Romania, I worked on many applications in different specialties such as dentistry, pharmacy, molecular biology, as well as on specific problems involving EHRs, image processing, and others. Since 2002, I also acted as an expert evaluator for the e-Health unit of DG InfSoc (later DG Connect) of the European Commission. I was very happy to see that the EC included fundamental research topics in their calls, mainly around what later came to be called the \u201cVirtual Physiological Human\u201d frame, topics supported by Jean-Claude Healy and Ilias Iakovidis. A subgroup of RSMI formed a more specialized professional association in 2003\u2014 ProRec Romania, chaired innitially by me (continued by Mircea Focsa), which became a member of the EuroRec Institute, led then by Georges De Moor (and now by Dipak Kalra), and was a member of the consortia of several European projects. After two years as secretary and two years as vice-president, I became EFMI\u2019s president in 2006. I started my presidency by organizing the STC 2006 in Timisoara on the topic \u201cIntegrating Bio-Medical Informatics: from e-Cell to e-Patient\u201d. It was also the right moment to thank Professor Jan H. van Bemmel for his support in the early days of medical informatics in Romania: he was bestowed the title of \u201cDoctor Honoris Causa of the University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Timisoara\u201d. For the period of my EFMI presidency, I promoted the slogan \u201cLet\u2019s make EFMI more visible\u201d (which, fortunately, was kept by all my successors). Some notable achievements included: (1) making official the EFMI contacts with the European Commission\u2014EFMI received a position for a representative in the \u201ce-Health Stakeholders Group\u201d and was included among the co- organizers of \u201ce-health days\u201d organized annually by the EC; (2) established contacts with HIMSS, participating in the series of \u201cWoHIT \u2013 World of Health IT\u201d congresses and exhibitions; (3) became EFMI\u2019s representative to the \u201cVPH \u2013 Virtual Physiological Human\u201d consortium; (4) started a collaboration with AMIA, signing a bilateral convention protocol with Don Detmer, which later became a \u201cTrilateral convention\u201d when Jack Li affiliated APAMI with the group. As was the tradition for EFMI, I became its representative on the IMIA Board in 2008, extending contacts and collaborations. The Trilateral convention started to work under IMIA\u2019s umbrella and led to several actions\u2014workshops, panels and a project: \u201cTrEHRT \u2013 Traveler\u2019s EHR Template\u201d. I also became member of the Editorial Board of IMIA\u2019s Yearbook of Medical Informatics. The IMIA General Assembly 2009 in Hiroshima approved the creation of the Bio- Medical Informatics History Task Force, charged with collecting and organizing information\u2014relevant facts, documents, etc.\u2014about events and people who have played an important role in the development of medical informatics, and preparing the th celebration of the 50 anniversary of the formation IFIP-TC 4 by Fran\u00e7ois Gr\u00e9my in 1967, which later became IMIA. This task force became the IMIA Working Group on the History of Bio-Medical Informatics, chaired by Casimir Kulikowski and with Valerio Y\u00e1cubsohn and myself as vice-chairs. Later we were joined by Hyeoun-Ae Park and Bob Greenes. The WG organized several panels and workshops, receiving the WG of the Year Award for 2014, presented at the IMIA General Assembly in S\u00e3o Paulo at Medinfo 2015.

The title of my doctoral dissertation is \"Nursing Leadership when an Electronic Patient Record System is Introduced in Norwegian Hospitals\u201d while the title of my master\u2019s thesis is \"Information Technology Introduced in the Nursing Service\". I am a registered nurse (RN), graduating in 1985 from R\u00f8de Kors Sykepleierh\u00f8yskole i Oslo og Akershus, Norway. In 1989 I graduated as a Regional College Candidate, in Business administration, \u00d8stfold Distriktsh\u00f8gskole (\u00d8stfold University College), Halden, Norway. In addition, I studied University didactics and teaching at the University of Oslo (2001) and Research Management (2010-2011) at Copenhagen Business School, Denmark. I worked as a staff nurse and head nurse in the Department of Internal Medicine and the cardiac observation unit, at Sentralsykehuset i Akershus (Akerhus University  Hospital), Norway from 1985 \u2013 1991. From 1991 to 1994, I was one of the hospital\u2019s domain experts recruited to participate in the design and deployment of an Electronic Patient Record System (EHR). The EHR was developed at the National Institute for Public Health, piloted at Sentralsykehuset i Akershus, Nordbyhagen, Norway, and is still in operation in some Norwegian hospitals. From 1996 till 2002 I was a research fellow at the Institute of Nursing Science, University of Oslo, and postdoc from 2002 \u2013 2005 at InterMedia, Faculty of Education, University of Oslo, Oslo. I was Fulbright Scholar at the University of Wisconsin \u2013 Madison (UW), College of Engineering and School of Nursing from 2001- 2002, and then continued the collaboration as a visiting research scientist at UW-Madison from 2002 to 2006. From 2005 to 2011 I was associate professor at the Institute for Nursing and Health sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, and project leader at InterMedia, Faculty of Education, University of Oslo, Oslo. I joined the faculty at the Institute of Health and Society, Department of Nursing Science, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo in 2007, and was appointed Full Professor at the Institute of Health and Society in 2011. I was a visiting scholar at the University of California, San Francisco, USA (1998, 2000), a visiting scholar at the University of Wisconsin \u2013 Madison, USA (2003-2008), an adjunct professor there from 2015 to 2017, and a visiting professor at Brigham-Women\u2019s Hospital, in 2015. I currently also serve as adjunct professor at the University of South- east Norway since 2017. A. Moen (Upper Row, Left) EuroMISE Meeting, Czech Republic, 2013 ", "Jose Luis Monteagudo": "Professor, National School of Public Health, Spain Former Head of Research Unit, Telemedicine and eHealth, Carlos III Health Institute, Madrid My first steps in computer research date back to 1966. I was a student at the School of Telecommunications Engineering and together with some colleagues, we started a working group on \u201cComputing Machines\u201d under the mentoring of Prof. Montoya Vitini. We were very attracted to cybernetics and specifically the parallels between digital computers and the brain. In that environment I undertook research on digital gates as computing elements with noise, inspired by neural models. The results were presented at the 1968 IEEE Student Contest in Paris just a few days before the May events. After graduating in 1969, I was working at ITT Laboratories Spain on designing and building a parallel and fault-tolerant computing system for the Metaconta L switching system. It allowed me to participate at the ITT working group for developing a new generation of big computers. All this meant acquire experience in computer systems which was extremely useful in my future career. In 1973, I had the opportunity of meeting Professor Jos\u00e9 M. R. Delgado, who was then director of neurobehavioral laboratory at Yale University Medical School, and joining his team. Proessor Delgado enjoyed high international prestige for his contributions to the study of mental function, emotional patterns and social behaviour, using experimental models with primates. One goal of his research was mapping a functional brain atlas reflecting anatomical correlations of behavioural effects using tele- electrical and chemical stimulation at specific points in the brain. My stay at Yale University offered me the opportunity of glimpsing the potential of using computers in biomedical research. In particular, I was able to establish contact with Kenneth Lifshitz at the Research Centre of the Rockland State Hospital in Orangeburg, NY and to find out about his research on computerised analysis of the EEG and sensory- evoked potentials for identifying intellectual and emotional processes in patients with schizophrenia. It was very enlightening to discuss the development of an improved operating system for the online use of the IBM 360-44 system and especially the innovative features of the LINC computer generation developed by Digital Equipment Corporation for application in scientific environments, which foreshadowed the structure and principles of PCs. While at Yale, I was tasked with the design and implementation of the computing infrastructure for the new Department of Physiology in the Department of Medicine of the Autonomous University of Madrid and the Research Department of the Ram\u00f3n y Cajal Hospital, where Dr. Delgado also served as director. The data processing centre was built around the PDP 12 system (a combination of LINC and PDP8) which was later expanded with a PDP 11.50. My research work in biomedical computing at the Ramon y Cajal Hospital in Madrid (1975) was focused on modelling primate behaviour, which formed the basis of my doctoral thesis entitled \u201cCharacterisation of stochastic generators from observing finite  output sequences with application to the recognition of behaviour patterns.\u201d The thesis addressed issues related to complexity analysis, synthesis of probabilistic automata, Markov processes and pattern recognition. In parallel, I worked on electronic systems interfaces that could be implanted in the brain for electrical stimulation as well as EEG biotelemetry, collaborating closely with the hospital\u2019s neurology and neurosurgery clinical services. In the early 80's and following the retirement of Professor Delgado, I was appointed Head of the Bioengineering Service at the same Research Department of the Ram\u00f3n y Cajal Hospital, with growing involvement in the ICT R&D applied in the clinic. In those years, it is worth to highlight my participation in the European project Multimed (RACE 1042) on multimedia communications in medicine, using the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) then under development for connecting hospitals in Spain, France and the UK. Joining the Carlos III Health Institute. In 1989, I moved to the Carlos III Health Institute (ISCIII), which had been just created at the Ministry of Health as the Public Research Agency at the service of the State and Spanish Regions. According to the Ministry of Health policy, my activity was focused on promoting research on ICT for Health aligned with the EU RDT Programs. This allowed me to create the Research Unit on Telemedicine and eHealth that was devoted to research into Electronic Health Records, interoperability, telemedicine and personal mobile healthcare for treating chronic diseases, as well as promoting standards and educational activities. Work on Electronic Health Records included participation in European projects such as PROREC (Promotion of Electronic Health Records in Europe, 1996-1999) and WIDENET (Offering world services through an international network on Electronic Health Records, 2001-2003) which led to the foundation of PROREC Spain and the EUROREC Institute, collaborating closely with Dr. Juan Reig and other European colleagues. Research on Telemedicine was developed at the European level with projects such as HECTOR (Integrating Health Telematics in Emergency, 1996-1999); TELEPLANS (Telemedicine for Citizens in Europe, 1998-2000) and MOBI-DEV (Mobile devices for healthcare applications, 2001-2003). A quite important strategic action was the creation and coordination of the National Network of Thematic Research Groups on Telemedicine (2003-2005) which was continued with the PITES Innovation Platform for Telemedicine, operating from 2008 until the present. PITES involves a network of 12 university hospitals in different regions throughout Spain. It is aimed at implementing new service models for chronic diseases in open standards-based digital ecosystems, geared particularly toward interoperability, security and decision-making support. A number of projects were developed addressing digital personal environments for health and welfare; the evaluation of mobile telemedicine systems, and the definition, design, development and evaluation of services for monitoring, follow-up and control of elderly people in independent living spaces. Our experience included the execution of a wide range of pilots and clinical trials for hypertension, heart failure, COPD, anticoagulation therapy, asthma, obesity and cardiac rehabilitation of patients, in partnership with hospitals and health professionals who are leaders in their clinical specialties. Involvement in the development of R&D on Health ICT in the EU. My involvement in European research programs has been one of the most important facets of my activities in the world of biomedical informatics. This relationship dates back to 1986 when I was appointed national delegate of the DG XII\u2019s COMAC-BME. Here I  had the opportunity of collaborating in the development of the health technology domain within the nascent European Research Framework Program, and come in contact with large group of colleagues from other countries promoting projects in domains such as telemonitoring, ECG analysis and medical imaging. In this capacity I was privileged to witness the development of the BICEPS study and I participated actively in the birth of the CEC-DG XIII\u2019s AIM Exploratory Action and its development as a Member of the Management Committee (1987-1991). I was also coordinator of the final conference \u201cAIM Euroforum\u201d held in December 1990 in Seville. My collaboration with the AIM program was continued in successive Framework Programmes serving as a member of the AIM Technical Audit Panel (1990); AIM Requirements Board (1993); AIM Working Party (1992-1994); Health/Elderly and Disabled Working Group of the Telematics Programme (1996-1999); Health Working Group of the Information Society Technology Programme (2000-2004) and the DG\u2019s i- 2010-eHealth Subcommittee (INFO, 2004-2010). I was likewise engaged in other EC activities such as participation in the Health Care Applications ENS Preparatory Exercise (Telematics for Administrations, 1992) and the Healthcare Telematics Group of the SANCO High-Level Health Committee (2000-2004). Another significant activity was the ERA eHealth project on the Creation of the European Research Area in eHealth (2005-2007) with a special contribution on ICT for patient empowerment. In line with policies promoting research on the application of ICT for aging I was much involved in the creation and development of the AAL (Ambient Assisted Living) European Joint Programme, where I have served as Proxy National Delegate and as a member of the Content Group (2007-2013). Also along the same lines I contributed to the B3 Action Group on \u201cIntegrated Care on Chronic Diseases including remote monitoring at regional level\u201d since its creation at the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing (EIP-AHA) and as a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of the ProEIPAHA Support Action (2015-2017). In addition to the European context, I have maintained personal and institutional relationships with colleagues and institutions in Latin America, such as with the Ministry of Health of Uruguay and the WHO-PAHO. Regarding standardization activities, I actively participated in the foundation of AENOR\u2019s CTN 139 (Spanish Standardization Body), a mirror of CEN TC25, of which I served as president since 1996, always with the support of the Spanish Society of Health Informatics (SEIS). A quite interesting international experience was the standardizing of EDI messages for Healthcare, participating in the Western European EDIFACT Board (WEEB) - EBES (1995-1998) and developing pharmacovigilance message reporting in collaboration with the agencies of UK, France, Spain and WHO Europe. Dedication to Teaching. My education and training work has been closely linked to my activities in biomedical informatics since I began them. Already in 1981, I had the opportunity to collaborate on the first Medical Informatics course offered by the Polytechnic University of Madrid by Dr. Salvador Arribas, one of the pioneers of computer technology in healthcare in Spain. My scope of action has been primarily on post-graduate teaching as a professor at the National School of Public Health where I am currently director of the Master\u2019s Degree in ICT System Management offered since 2013 under the auspices of SEIS. Other academic centres where I have taught include the National University of Distance Education (UNED), the Men\u00e9ndez y Pelayo International University, the Carlos III University of Madrid, and the Catalonia Open University (UOC).  My participation in the European IT-EDUCTRA project (Education and Training of Health Professionals on Information Technologies, 1996-1999) provided a great source of knowledge and development of teaching materials for designing medical informatics curricula. Some considerations. My personal trajectory over the past 50 years has been accompanied by the extraordinary development of computer science and its convergence with telecommunications and electronics, which has resulted in undeniable changes in healthcare. Everything we have seen so far indicates that this is only the beginning of a great wave of digital transformation coming in the near future. To address the emerging challenges, it is essential to foster research, innovation and education in ICT for Health at all levels. Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to receive advice, learning and in many cases enjoying the friendship of many colleagues to whom I owe a debt of gratitude. These people include Luis Kun, Niels Rossing, Juan Reig, Luciano Saez and Joaquin Marquez, to name a few. After my retirement in 2013, I have had the personal satisfaction of seeing how ISCIII\u2019s Telemedicine and eHealth Research Unit has advanced in its research activity under the direction of my colleagues Carlos Hernandez and Adolfo Mu\u00f1oz. My current efforts are focused on teaching, and at the scientific level on the application of Complex Socio-Technological Systems to ICT for health, somehow closing the cycle of \u201ccybernetic\u201d attraction at the start of my career. Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), Madrid, Spain ", "Christian N\u00f8hr": "Professor, Health Informatics, Maersk Mc-Kinney Moeller Institute, University of Southern Denmark Chair, IMIA WG Human Factors Engineering for Healthcare Informatics Vice President, Danish Society for Digital Health When I started my studies at Aalborg University in 1978, I was building on professional training as an C. N\u00f8hr, M.Sc., PhD, FACMI, FIAHSI electronic technician from manufacturing industry and pursuing a master\u2019s degree in electronic engineering. During the first years of my studies, inspiring teachers and stimulating fellow students inspired me to learn how it was possible to measure electrical signals in the human body. During the common study projects with clinicians at the hospital I also discovered that the success of innovative technology depends on the implementation and concrete use of the technology. I completed my master\u2019s degree studying planning in the public healthcare sector. Combining public planning and the use of advanced information technologies made it clear that theories and methods from the social sciences and the humanisties were necessary to gather data and analyze the specific work and tasks of clinicians. That brought me into technology assessment activities \u2013 an area in rapid development internationally. I managed to convince the Danish Research Council to fund my PhD study where I was trying to develop theories to assess rapidly changing technologies, such as computerized decision support systems (CDSS) in healthcare. To complete a traditional health technology assessment (HTA) took significantly longer time than the development and implementation of new features in CDSS, hence there was a need to develop a constructive healthcare technology assessment. In the pursuit of such an approach I spend one year at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston with Dr. Stanley J. Reiser. Information technology in health care did at that time not receive substantial attention among HTA researchers as it was difficult or impossible to perform traditional randomized controlled studies, and the economic aspects were extremely difficult to analyze, as it involved an infrastructural component that was shared among many components of a healthcare institution. The traditional HTA was hardly the way forward to guide studies of the relation between information technology design, implementation and use, but at the University of Maastricht, Marc Berg was writing about the sociotechnical approach that exactly aims at understanding how information technology in healthcare is developed, implemented and becomes part of social practices. This understanding is consequently used to redesign and improve the technology. Marc Berg\u2019s approach was building on that of French philosopher Bruno Latour, and his thoughts combined with the Scandinavian tradition of user participation in systems development paved the path for a long-lasting engagement in developing methods to involve end-users in the entire innovation and implementation process of health information technologies (HIT). In 1993 I initiated a Danish Master\u2019s program in Health Informatics at Aalborg University. Three departments contributed to the teaching in the program: Department  of Communication, Department of Health Technology, and my own Department of Development and Planning. A combination of distance and face to face teaching was applied and during the following years more than 450 candidates from Scandinavia have completed the program. The curriculum was developed while I participated in the concerted action on Education and Training (EDUCTRA), led by Professor Arie Hasman from the University of Maastricht, and the Aalborg program has been truly inspired by the curriculum guidelines from this project. One of the main components in the curriculum and my research has been the activation and involvement of the end users. During many research projects, it has been made clear that clinical decisions are predominantly based on information and knowledge obtained from interacting with colleagues and less from individual searching for information on evidence in databases. Hence it is relevant to study work situations where HIT systems are going to be used \u2013 the context of the situations where the systems are used. Two issues are important in such an approach: the usability of the systems and the organization of work tasks. This has been an imperative motivation for me to engage in the EFMI and IMIA working groups on organizational issues and human factors engineering for healthcare informatics. The working groups have also been the prime organizers of the International Conference on Context Sensitive Health Informatics. Craig Kuziemsky from Ottawa University, Canada, and I have been the main drivers of the last conferences held in Curitiba, Brazil and Hong Kong, China, and in Lille, France. There is a large unexploited learning potential in comparative analysis and evaluations of the use of HIT across countries and different health care systems. I have tried to open that potential by my engagement as adjunct professor at School of Computing and Information Systems, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Australia, and at the School of Health Information Science, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada. Comparative studies can also be very valuable at national levels comparing the outcome from national strategies. I currently manage the Nordic eHealth Research Network (NeRN) which is supported by The Nordic Council of Ministers. In NeRN we develop and test benchmarks and indicators that measure achievements in availability, use and outcome of HIT in the Nordic countries. Our approach and models have been published widely and also been a significant input to similar activities in the EU, OECD, and WHO. The most recent indicators also include surveys of the citizens in the Nordic countries, giving them a voice and enabling these end users to have a say. ", "Pirkko Nyk\u00e4nen": "Professor Emeritus, Health Informatics, University of Tampere, Finland Development Manager, National Institute for Health and Welfare My personal history with medical informatics started in 1975 in the VTT Medical Engineering Laboratory where I was employed as a senior systems designer already during my computer science studies. My early years (1975- 1985) were filled with health information systems design and programming, e.g. a laboratory information system for virology, dose planning systems for computer-based radiotherapy, Bayesian applications for acute appendicitis and simulation models of hospital information systems. With the rise of artificial intelligence and expert systems (1985-present), I was enthusiastically trying to improve health professionals\u2019 clinical work with decision support and we developed expert systems e.g. for interpretation of thyroid tests, for intensive care to monitor fluid balance and for microbiology to identify bacteria and plan the treatment of bacterial infections. These activities in artificial intelligence field were shared with our Nordic colleagues and led us to EU research collaboration with European colleagues in projects where many very challenging and interesting research activities were carried out from 1989 to 2003. Research was done in the fields of telematics, knowledge acquisition, laboratory medicine, integrated health system architectures, federated health care record architectures, evaluation and validation of IT applications in medicine, architectures for medical expert systems and application of advanced information technology for optimization of clinical laboratory services. National research activities were parallel ongoing, e.g. development and evaluation of the regional health information systems. My R&D activities were extended to evaluation issues like functionality, usability and impact evaluation of health information systems and development of guidelines for good evaluation practices of health information systems and technology. While starting as a university professor in 2003 my scope of activities was remarkably broadened with teaching and supervising of students and with extended research in the inspiring university environment and with international collaborations. We researched multimodal gaming environment promoting awareness of health in a social and positive way, medication management, and evaluation of the electronic prescription piloting in Finland from usability and information technology perspectives and with ubiquitous eHealth services: trusted eHealth and eWelfare space and citizen- centered health services. We also supported our national progress and development of IT infrastructure with the review of national health IT projects and with development of guidelines and principles for adoption of the Finnish nursing classification in the nursing documentation systems and by studying the integration alternatives of the electronic patient record systems with the national health IT infrastructure, and the possibilities for further development of reference-based regional health IT systems. Lessons learned in Finland with the national development were disseminated with Chinese partners to support the development of citizen-centered health care services and integration and  interoperability of health IT systems in China. During recent years my research has been focused on effects of integration of social and healthcare information systems and on the development of an ecosystem for procurement of social and health care services information systems. International collaboration has made it possible to work abroad as a visiting researcher: Lille University (France), Penn State University (USA) and Fudan University (China). These have been good learning experiences and I try to share lessons learned with developing countries in Africa throough volunteer work with health information systems. These activities and their progression during my working life reflect the changes in the focus of research in health informatics domains during decades \u2013 first focusing on individual, stand-alone systems, then on the issues of interoperability and integration with other health IT systems and the development of regional and national health information networks and national services, and finally inclusion of the citizen into the health care process, studying citizen-based services and the personalization of health care services. During recent years, as the importance of evaluation has become better understood, there is a growing need to find out the effects and impacts achieved with the health IT systems currently in use. The EFMI WG Evaluation of Health Information Systems (EVAL) has provided excellent support to this trend and has offered me since the 1990\u2019s an inspiring environment and active collaboration with the development of health informatics evaluation guidelines and approaches. Altogether, EFMI provides an inspiring discussion arena for scientific and practical health information issues, which I consider as having very important effects on my personal research activities. An inspiring person in my career has been professor Niilo Saranummi, Professor at VTT Medical Engineering Laboratory. He supported all his team to find interesting research topics and new innovations. During the Nordic collaboration I was happy to come to know professors Peter McNair and Jytte Brender and they have inspired me for new challenges and deep discussions. EU research collaboration has provided inspiration from many European colleagues, most important being professors Arie Hasman, Jan Talmon, Jane Grimson, Rory O\u2019Moore, Torgny Groth, Mario Stefanelli, Rolf Engelbrecht, Josipa Kern and Bernd Blobel. In the Euromise collaboration I have been very much inspired by Jana Zvarova who always had very relevant scientific ideas and research questions in mind, as well as Jan van Bemmel, the real \u201cgrand old man\u201d of the health informatics community. Collaboration with all EFMI WG participants has been very fruitful, especially with Elske Ammenwerth, Nicolet de Keizer and Michael Rigby, who have been very inspiring collaborators on evaluation issues. I am happy that with many of the above persons, our scientific discussion and collaborations are still ongoing. Since the 1970\u2019s, health informatics has made much progress. However, we still face many problems before we can speak about evidence-based health informatics. To have explicit evidence we need to perform more scientifically rigorous evaluation studies to collect evidence that the systems developed and used are acceptable, safe and effective and support health professionals in their clinical tasks and even patients and citizens in managing their health. We also need to pay more attention to the design and implementation methods of health information systems in order to have predictably acceptable, safe and effective systems for user environments. The technological development has been very fast, and in many cases, we have paid more attention to the technologies applied than to the health care user context and health care service processes. Today the challenge is to manage health information entities at all levels, at the personalized patient, citizen level and at the societal level\u2014taking into account the varying health care cultures and contexts. ", "Jos\u00e9 Luis Oliveira": "PhD, Electrical & Computer Engineering, Univ. of Aveiro, Portugal Co-founder & Scientific Director, BMD Software Scientific Coordinator, Bioinformatics Unit, BIOCANT My first work in medical informatics started in 1989 when, after joining the University of Aveiro as a Junior Assistant, I had to develop a medical image viewer to run on a MS-DOS based personal computer, as one of the tasks of an ongoing research project with Portuguese Telecom. This proved to be a challenge, considering the minimal set of software tools that we had at that time (e.g. fonts and character sets were built from scratch to allow text functionalities in the viewer) and at the end we were able to interconnect several image workstations with a single image archive, creating our first PACS solution (Picture archiving and communication system). Shortly afterwards, in 1992-94 I participated in the EURIPACS project (FP3) which gave me a broader perspective on PACS standards and solutions across Europe. Meanwhile, my background in ECE led me to pursue a PhD related to communication networks, and in particular network management, somewhat distant from medical informatics. So for about a decade I was mostly engaged in creating efficient solutions for distributed network management. However, being a researcher at one of the first Portuguese biomedical research centers, INESC-Aveiro (later IEETA), I kept a close connection with this field. I returned to medical informatics around 2002, when I started collaborating with Manuel A. S. Santos, a molecular biologist interested in understanding mRNA mistranslation. We partnered on research which has led to successful bioinformatics software tools for genomic analysis. At the same time, I got involved in InfoGenMed, one of the first European projects trying to bring together all available information about rare diseases, from the genotype to the phenotype. This research in bioinformatics and biomedicine addressed mainly the problem of biomedical data integration; namely, how to relate genotype information to phenotype data with a scalable and coherent system. This line of research led to several publications but most importantly to open source and publicly available software tools that are currently used by a broad spectrum of institutions and end-users. An example is the diseasecard.org portal which integrates real-time information about rare diseases, from distributed and heterogeneous medical and genomic databases. Another example is NeoScreen, a diagnostic decision support system for metabolic diseases, which has been used since 2004 in the Portuguese new-born screening program, having helped to diagnose more than 1 million children. As our integrative solutions evolved, we realized that a great deal of information was only available in the form of text, which prevents identifying the most relevant knowledge and creating richer structured repositories. So to complement the data gathering and integration approaches, together with S\u00e9rgio Matos and David Campos, we started to explore text mining techniques to extract information from text. We began this research by constructing Gimli, an open source tool for automatic recognition of biomedical concepts, which outperformed existing open and closed source solutions. We continued by developing an extensive framework (Neji) aimed at facilitating the building  of text mining biomedical applications. More recently, we have developed Egas, a web- based platform for biomedical text mining and collaborative curation. All these tools have been used in several international challenges, such as BioCreative, where we have shown significant results. Following information extraction and data integration objectives, a third area where I have been working is knowledge representation. We developed COEUS, an open source framework to facilitate the semantic integration from heterogeneous data sources and formats. This platform works as a semantic translator, allowing the creation of custom semantic warehouses from multiple and distributed data resources. In 2011, together with Carlos Costa, we founded BMD Software, a company dedicated to the development of medical imaging solutions (e.g. PACS and RIS), biomedical applications (e.g. genotype-to-phenotype data integration), and knowledge extraction in health and life science industries (text mining and knowledge representation). In the above R&D, many fruitful collaborations were established, and I am deeply grateful to the many colleagues and students without whom these results could not have been achieved. The biomedical tools resulting from this collaborative effort are all publically available at http://bioinformatics.ua.pt/software/. To conclude, the decoding of the human genome, and all the subsequent research in the -omics fields, have led to new areas of research that have significantly extended the scope of original medical informatics. Bioinformatics, biomedicine, and translational biomedicine are now appealing research topics and many projects are underway in these areas. From my experience, despite the increasing need for skilled researchers in each topic, we still need to keep the focus on the original research fields\u2014on genomics, proteomics, medical specialities, computer science, and others\u2014so that well-prepared professionals in each field can collaborate to better attain multidisciplinary research objectives. Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety, 2012; 22: 459-467 ", "Alejandro Pazos": "Co-Director, Biomedical Informatics and Radiology Diagnostic Center Professor of Computer Science, University of A Coru\u00f1a How I came to medical informatics My entry into the world of medical informatics came towards the end of the 1980\u2019s while working and studying obstetrics and gynecology at the Provincial Hospital of Santiago de Compostela in Spain. Maybe my curiosity in informatics was piqued by one of my thirteen brothers, Juan, who used to bring punched A. Pazos, MD, MS, PhD cards with him to our summer home in Padron. Juan was, until he retired recently, a profesor of computer science and artificial intelligence at the Polytecnic University of Madrid, and a pioneer with a vision that inspired me to take the road of medical informatics and leave the daily practice of medicine. I was helped in making this decisi\u00f3n by the support of my chief of service in OBGYN, Dr. Raul Murillo, who encouraged me to come to Madrid to do whatever I needed to do in order to specialize in this new informatics discipline. My brother Juan Pazos was instrumental in introducing the first Master\u2019s program in Spain in Knowledge Engineering, and in 1987, the first Spanish group of what can be considered to be biomedical informatics, made up of two physicians, and one biologist\u2014 Drs. Victor Maojo, and myself for the former, and Dr. Fernando Martin for the latter. It was also Juan\u2019s suggestion that we ought to continue our studies with a post- doctoral international experience. We were fortunate to do this at Georgia Institute of Technology in the Medical Informatics Lab set up there by Dr. Norberto Ezquerra. Ever since then Victor, Fernando and I have been close on profesional as well as personal friendship terms. We were also lucky to come to know pioneers in AI, such as Prof. John Holland of the University of Michigan and Professor Jaime Carbonell of CMU. It was around this time that we also came to know of the pioneering work of Ted Shortliffe at Stanford, and Professor Robert Greenes at Harvard, who helped sponsor and supervise the post-doctoral work of Victor Maojo and myself at Harvard Medical School. In 1988, together with Fernando we obtained a first research grant in Spain for working on a medical informatics system, which was a knowledge engineering Project at the UPM (Polytechnic Institute of Madrid) called \u201cSIAC, an integrated system for assistance in cases of emergency\u201d. This was an expert system carried out in collaboration with Dr. Antonio Hernando, a specialist in evaluating damage to the body, who worked in intensive care in the Hospital 12 de Octubre of Madrid. With data from a straighforward physical examination carried out in 60 seconds involving cardio- pulmonary and circulatory, and neurologic systems, it could \u201ctriage\u201d patients brought into the emergency room for treatment due to accidents, whether natural or produced by human interaction. The system was able to considerably cut down the significant number of patients requiring further treatment. Then in 1989, with the leadership of Juan Pazos we were able to establish a Department of Artificial Intelligence at UPM, together with an oficial group in Medical  Informatics\u2014the first in Spain, for which we received essential support from IBM. So, I came to medical informatics, first as a student of medicine and scholarship student in OBGYN at the Hospital in Santiago de Compostela and later, as a consulting physician there. This helped me obtain a master\u2019s degree, and later a doctorate in engineering informatics, since I realized that I needed to deepen my knowledge considerably. During my studies I came to appreciate the differences between the logical vs. the conexionist branches of AI, which led me to see that most results in medicine are highly adaptive and uncertain, leading me to a dissertation on \u201cA Heutistic Procedure applied to the neuroglial parallelism in computation\u201d receiving a Cum Laude grade on the examination. In this thesis I showed how one can use heuristic methods for efficient information processing, showing just how prescient was the work of Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal on glial cells, which are still today usually treated as the \u201cpoor relatives\u201d of the overwhelming neural cells, and as such largely ignored in information processing in the brain. After a most productive post-doctoral year at Georgia Tech, on Graphics, Visualization and Usability, I returned to Spain to take up a position at the recently created Faculty of Informatics in the University of A Coruna (UDC). It was ironic that in this way, a physician became the first to head an informatics engineering program in this department. Thanks to my complementary experiences as physician and engineer, I became a principal investigator on a grant from the Spanish ministry of science and technology. This involved an integrated system for tele-diagnosis, and distance-followup of patients with prostheses of the hip. I received critical clinical support from Dr. Antonio Piernas at UDC, who was also an emergency care physician at the Canalejo Hospital in A Coruna. Later, as PI, I was awarded a grant to investigate the role of neural networks in influencing obstetric outcomes, such as comfort during childbirth, and fetal delivery in particular. Having previously worked at the Provincial Hospital of A Coru\u00f1a, I was motivated to improve the workflow there, and after I completed my dissertation I received a \u201ccum laude\u201d degree for this research and development. In the following 25 years, I headed the group on neural nets and adaptive systems, as well as the center for medical imaging and radiological diagnosis leading to the publication of more than 150 papers, covering over 50 projects competitively awarded with 25 enterprise contracts and 25 doctoral dissertations, seven of which were implemented and put into practice, receiving more than 25 patents and software registrations with two of them still being in routine use. In recent years, our work has been recognized with a medal from the Spanish Navy for teaching cyberdefense and technologies of information and communication, the National Prize for Health Informatics by the Spanish Society SEIS in 2015, and recognition as Academic of Honor in 2016 by the Professional College of Informatics Engineering, as well as being named a corresponding member of the Academy of Pharmacy of Galicia for my work on pharma-informatics. All this work would not have come about without the help of my teachers and colleagues from whom I have learned something every day. I want to thank my over 100 collaborators in RNASA-IMEDIR, and especially my wife Joli and children Carla and Alejandro, who have supported me most kindly and tolerantly, since my work has taken away so many hours from our lives together. Without their help this journey of personal and professional development could never have taken place. ", "Mor Peleg": "Professor & Past Chair, Information Systems, University of Haifa Department Chair, Data Science BSc program and Research Center Visiting Associate Professor, Stanford Biomedical Informatics Associate Editor, Journal of Biomedical Informatics Informatics = multidisciplinary collaboration Since attending a youth science camp at the Weitzman Institute, Israel in 1984, I knew that I wanted to be working at the intersection of biomedicine and computers. Through undergraduate and graduate school at the Technion, I was searching for the right path. I started with computer science and electrical engineering, but soon moved to pursue biology, which was very dear to my heart. Alas, the wet lab was clearly no place for me. Inspired by the human genome project, I decided in 1994 to pursue a PhD in Information Systems Engineering. I though that with my programming background, and my sense that organizing knowledge came easily to me, I could contribute to science much more by developing methods to integrate the growing body of knowledge being produced in biology labs rather than doing basic research. But there were not so many professors at the Technion at that time who could advise me on such a topic, so my dissertation focused on real-time process modeling. Toward the end of my thesis work (in 1999), Yuval Shahar was visiting from Stanford and gave a talk at the faculty colloquium on knowledge-based temporal abstraction. I was fascinated and realized that domain knowledge is essential for automated reasoning. I talked to him at length after his seminar and he encouraged me to apply for a post-doctoral position at Stanford in Medical Informatics. I searched the Internet and found Mark Musen\u2019s web page from which I ftp\u2019d (you didn\u2019t download in those days) an early version of Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and played with it. I loved it and appreciated how powerful it was for structural domain modeling (I had no idea about ontologies at that time). It occurred to me to introduce procedural aspects into Prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s meta-model and I wrote to Mark asking if he would accept me as a post-doc in his lab. After some nudging from Yuval, Mark answered that he loved the idea (but that unfortunately he did not at the moment have funding or space for me). Having studied English (but not American), I was delighted to receive such an enthusiastic reply and immediately went to apply for a research grant from Israel. (I reasoned that space wouldn\u2019t be a problem because I could work from home; in fact, this would be easier for me with two young kids.) I asked Mark to sign a letter of support for my application and two months later I received a positive reply and here I was, on my way to Stanford! Mark suggested that I might also apply for a post-doc position with Ted Shortliffe, who had just received a renewal of the InterMed grant. Stanford was a big revelation to me. The work with the wonderful researchers in InterMed (Ted Shortliffe, Samson Tu, Bob Greenes, Vimla Patel, and many others), with Mark\u2019s Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Group, and later with Russ Altman, has shaped my thinking about how to conduct methodological and rigorous scientific research, enforce ethics, and appreciate the central role of a friendly and supportive work environment, where the opinion of faculty, students, and staff are sought after and appreciated. I try to create such relationships in my research teams and to mentor my own students and new faculty in  similar ways. I love every opportunity that I have to interact with my mentors because till this day, they encourage me to do things that I wouldn\u2019t otherwise have had the confidence to do. These are not limited to research, but include leadership roles in organizing conferences and workshops, in journal editorial boards, and professional committees. I have learned from my mentors that research in informatics should not only be novel but should have substantial contributions to both informatics and medicine. The vision of the InterMed Collaboratory was to create a new generation of the Guideline Interchange Language (GLIF3) \u2013 a guideline modeling language that is executable and sharable. Thus, a narrative guideline could be represented as a formal computer- interpretable guideline (CIG), uploaded to a CIG library, from which many other institutions could download it and adapt it to their local environment. During patient encounters, a CIG engine would serve as a decision-support system (DSS) that would match CIG knowledge to patient data (from an EHR), providing patient-specific recommendations at the point of care. In this way we would not need to assume that practitioners are reading all of the current guidelines, and that they remember them and apply them to their patients. I have continued to expand my work in this area to address emerging challenges that I faced when implementing Decision Support Systems (DSSs), including how to make guideline authoring lend itself better to computerization, handle exceptions that arise during care processes, support sharing and integration of a DSS within different healthcare settings, which also use different EHR schemas, via the use of ontologies and query generators, and how to involve users in the DSS design. All that time, I had the pleasure to collaborate with the best researchers in our field. The vision of InterMed remains a major goal of my research. In the past few years, this goal has been intertwined with the goal of patient empowerment. Encouraged by my colleagues and long-time collaborators Yuval Shahar, Silvana Quaglini, and Silvia Miksch, I led the large-scale European project MobiGuide: Guiding Patients Anytime, Everywhere (http://www.mobiguide-project.eu/). This project involved over 60 researchers, clinicians and engineers, from 13 different organizations in five countries. MobiGuide is a scalable, secure, ubiquitously accessible, and user-friendly mobile solution for designing, deploying, and maintaining a DSS for patients and their care providers. The novelty of the approach is in patient-centrality, personalization, and distribution of decision-support for patients who use a mobile DSS that includes a Smartphone and wearable sensors and interacts with the main web-based DSS of the clinicians. The DSS is based on clinical guidelines and personal health records and provides personalized evidence-based clinical recommendations. Our proof of concept 9-month evaluation (in the domains of gestational diabetes Mellitus with 20 patients in a hospital in Spain and ten atrial fibrillation patients in Italy) has demonstrated an increase in patients' satisfaction and in their compliance to evidence-based clinical guidelines as well as an impact on clinician decisions. This project has also pointed me to new research directions that I am pursuing: integrating CIGs for comorbid patients, which I hope could be aided by semantic-web reasoning, mobile health, and using IT tools and behavioral economics strategies to motivate patients to make lifestyle changes and improve their health. Another challenge that has great impact on the translation of clinical knowledge to structured representation is the high dependency on human experts and the lack of evidence-based studies to support complete care processes. I have collaborated with Samson Tu and Ida Sim to generate scalable semi-automated methods for evolving  clinical protocols from narratives. I have been experimenting with using data mining, including text processing, to generate data-based evidence that could be used for decision-support. My systems biology work that started at Stanford with Russ Altman relied on combining domain ontologies with Business Process Management - formalisms including workflows and Petri nets as well as ontologies in order to simulate biological processes and learn about the completeness of the model from its ability to produce behavior that matches results of biological experiments. I have continued this work in collaboration with Prof. Wil van der Aalst and as PI in an NIH Center for Computational Neuropsychiatric Genomics, focused on autism, headed by Prof. Andrey Rzhetsky. Together with my post-doctoral student, Judith Somekh and in collaboration with Prof. Zak Kohane, we developed a method for using Petri-net based models to find molecular- level processes that are implicated to be involved in several comorbities that are manifested in different tissues and organs. We demonstrated its application for shedding light on a potential disease mechanism of autism and immune bowl disorder. ", "Hans E. Peterson (1928 - 2021)": "Ophthalmology Fellow at the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm University Faculty of Ophthalmology & Medical Informatics, Karolinska Institute Fellow and President of EFMI, IMIA (1983\u20131986) Fellow of ACMI and IAHSI From Ophthalmology to Health Informatics I was born in 1928 in a small town named Kalskoga in the western part of Sweden. A better-known person from that town is Alfred Nobel. I started my university studies in Stockholm at the Institute of Electricity at the Royal College of Technology. I always had wanted to become a medical doctor and a year later I was accepted as a student at the Karolinska Institute. Around this time, I also started my family and my first son was born. In 1953, after the third year of my studies at the Karolinska Institute, I was asked to work during the summer in the chemical laboratory at the Roslagstull hospital. The Head Doctor at the Laboratory, Ingmar Jungner MD, and his brother Gunnar Jungner MD at Sahlgrenska University hospital in Gothenburg had started a project together with the aim to automate laboratory analyses. I got involved in their discussions and we shared our thinking, which led us to realize that we lacked basic knowledge about computers and how to get them to fulfill our needs. I was sent to Germany together with an engineer from AGA (the major Swedish industrial gas company) to begin becoming \u201ccomputer-literate\u201d during a two- week course in programming, which was in machine-language at that time. From those days onwards it has been a continuing learning process for me on how to use computers and information methods, with courses, experiences and the teaching of students. As one realizes, a two-week course would not make me into a programmer. But the AGA guy and I came up with an idea about how to speed up the processes of analyses we needed in order to implement them on the computer accessible to us. However, during the next three years I did not have much time to participate in the programing of the laboratory system, since I was still pursuing my studies and also had my own family with a small child to care for. But I kept contact with the Jungner brothers and took part in their interesting discussions when I could. After having completed my studies at the Karolinska Institute, in 1956 I started my career towards becoming an ophthalmologist at the Karolinska Hospital. At the time, Professor Karpe in the ophthalmology department was involved in screening of soldiers for the Swedish Defense Organization. I was asked to be a member of the team which developed the standards of physical perception that the soldiers had to satisfy, and the ways in which they were to be based on observations and measurements. It was a good experience and, on the computer side, I learned how to store data on the newly developed punched cards! When I started my doctoral studies in 1963, I had a fairly good understanding of what computers could do. My research material were 2000 patient records. There were 68 data items per patient and one card per patient was sufficient. These cards I then transferred to a tape. The Karolinska hospital had access to an IBM 340, on which I was allowed to run my calculations during the night hours and Sundays only.  During these activities, I met Paul Hall who was a doctor in the Thoracic Medicine Department. He was also responsible for coordinating access to the computer I needed to use. He became my tutor on computer matters, and later was one of the two examiners for my thesis defense. In Sweden the defense of academic theses is a public event. There are two examiners, or opponents and a committee elected by the Karolinska Institute. The first opponent presents the thesis to the committee and the audience. The candidate then has to defend the thesis. Paul Hall was one of the opponents since he was one of the people most experienced in the use of computers in Sweden at that time. He had developed a computerized patient record where the data was collected in a standardized way by the patient, the professionals and the laboratories. Medical secretaries typed the new information into the computer on a daily base and an updated record was printed during the night, so it was available on the ward the following morning. I took my doctoral exam in 1968, and my professional plan was to work as a professor in ophthalmology at one of the Swedish university hospitals. However, in 1970 the director of Stockholm County offered me a position as head of the group in charge of the development and use of computers in health care within the County. There were at that time eight major hospitals, with more than 1000 beds, including Karolinska Hospital. My family was happy that we could remain in Stockholm, and the county council accepted that I should work as an ophthalmologist every Monday and gave me a generous budget for traveling to learn about computing systems in healthcare from the experiences in other countries. We developed and implemented systems to record and administer how patients held appointments with healthcare practitioners, and booking systems for outpatient clinics and laboratory systems. At this time the Swedish government took the initiative of building national databases for health statistics. In the 1970\u2019s, the Karolinska Institute decided to transfer my appointment in ophthalmology to one in health informatics. I retired from my work with Stockholm County after almost 30 years. I was the Monday ophthalmology doctor during all these years, and the combined experience of seeing patients while developing practical computer and information systems made for a most happy and fruitful professional experience. I have never regretted the choice I made in 1970. Apart from the very interesting informatics and biomedical and healthcare development work, I have had the pleasure of working with deeply engaged and professional colleagues. I have also had the opportunity to engage in related professional and important societal work, such as serving as head of the Swedish delegation to the European Standardization organization and expert consultant for the Swedish National Board of Health and Social Services in Health Informatics for many years. It was important to my employer, the County Council, that we kept up to date with international developments and experiences in the field. At the beginning it was just a very small number of us who established national and international societies to share knowledge and experience with computers and informatics in medicine. I was one of the first members of the Swedish Society of Health Informatics (as it is called today) and actively supported the establishment of IMIA and EFMI. Under the umbrella of IFIP the first MedInfo conference was held in Stockholm in 1974. I was a member of the organizing committee and presented a paper with the title \u201cA planning and scheduling system for patient admission to surgical departments\u201d and also chaired the session on \u201cImproving patient administration in hospitals.\u201d  The European national organizations of medical informatics were not pleased with IFIP\u2019s control of the finances of IFIP-TC4 (the precursor organization to IMIA), and specifically with the fact that profits from successful TC4 conferences went back to IFIP. For this reason, the European Federation of Medical Informatics (EFMI) was founded as an independent organization. I supported the effort to establish EFMI and I am glad that it has become a successful organization within IMIA. As Swedish representative to IFIP- TC4, I became involved in helping it became less dependent on IFIP, and in 1980 was elected incoming president of IMIA. At that time the IMIA president\u2019s term was three years. I worked hard with then-president David Shires MD from Canada to make IFIP let go of IMIA and allow us to become a free-standing organization. The stories of that time are told in the paper named Early history of International Federations of Medical Informatics [4]. We succeeded, and finally, at the Washington, DC Medinfo in 1986, IMIA was officially declared an independent organization. I was also member of the board and treasurer to one of the German-speaking societies for Medical Informatics. The members of this society came mainly from the German speaking countries: Germany, Austria and Switzerland, but also from Denmark, Sweden, France, The Netherlands, Luxembourg and Belgium. I learned to speak German in school and the literature at the Karolinska institute was in German during my first years. My experiences and the system we developed and implemented in the Stockholm County have taken me to Cape Town in South Africa and to Kuwait where we implemented copies of the Stockholm county system. During a number of years, I regularly had a two weeks course and taught medical informatics to physicians and system implementers in Italy. For that I was awarded the Italian Republic\u2019s Order \u2018For Merit\u2019 III degree, by the President. I have also been honored with the IFIP Silver Core Award in 1986 and the IMIA Award of Excellence in 2010\u2014for which I am most grateful. Cover of the proceedings of the first MEDINFO ", "Francesco Pinciroli": "Full Professor of Bioengineering & eHealth (Retired) Past Director of eHealthLAB Politecnico di Milano Senior Associate, Engineering & Wellbeing Research Group, National Research Council of Italy I remember well how I was first introduced to Medical and Health Informatics through Emanuele Biondi, pioneer of bioengineering in Italy. Among many \u201cfirsts\u201d, he initiated the first PhD Program in the country with the graduate and undergraduate curricula in Bioengineering at the Politecnico di Milano. Also F. Pinciroli, Laurea DG in EE, FIAHSI influencing me was Luigi Dadda, recognized for Dadda\u2019s Multiplier (IEEE Milestone in Electrical Engineering and Computing). He promoted an innovative public-private company, SAGO as the IT support for implementing the new Italian Healthcare Law. Maria Luisa Bozza Marrubini, chief anesthesiologist, and Augusto Beduschi, chief neurosurgeon, were clinicians who founded a Department of Neurosurgery that included an innovative Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit, at the Ca\u2019 Granda Hospital of Milano. Biondi\u2019s vision for Bioengineering recognized Information Technology as central, going well beyond electrical, mechanical and chemical engineering, while Dadda was insightful about public health\u2019s critical role, and Bozza Marrubini and Beduschi. emphasized patient needs. They all influenced me in major ways. My brothers-in-science became Luigi Divieti from my own department, and Mario Stefanelli from the University of Pavia, both of whom have unfortunately passed away. I graduated in Electronic Engineering from the Politecnico di Milan in 1969. While engineering in the service of medicine brought new buildings, it was not recognized as part of healthcare directly, nor a likely pathway towards an academic career. I, however, was inspired to bring technology to the practice of medicine, and later made the motto of the eHealthLAB, which I headed for twenty-five years at the Politecnico di Milano: \u201cEngineering for improving patient care by assisting doctors and institutions\u201d. At the beginning of the 1970\u2019s, in Italy, very few engineering professors paid much attention to medicine, so when applying for a graduate fellowship under my mentor Professor Biondi, I was fortunate to work on a project for choosing and purchasing the medical instrumentation for storing data continuously generated by bed monitors in the newly-formed neurosurgical intensive care unit at the Ca\u2019 Granda Hospital, leading to a second fellowship supported by Gino Bozza funds. A Teaching and Research Training Biannual Fellowship then followed my compulsory military service. A NATO Fellowship at the Harvard-MIT Biomedical Engineering Center under Roger G. Mark as co-Director resulted in the book Changes in Health Care Instrumentation Due to rd Microprocessor Technology. The 3 SCAMC in 1979, showed me the opportunities for working in Medical Informatics both in depth and in breadth, but it proved difficult to have such courses approved for our bioengineering curriculum, so I had to improvise and use the classic Electric Circuits courses as a nurturing environment where bioengineering and informatics could grow. I feel very lucky to have found such opportunities.  In thinking about my career, I frame it as a journey on a sailing trip that made some very obvious changes of course. The first was the \u201cre-defining of medical instrumentation by IT\u201d. It was followed by \u201cdatabases for cardiology\u201d, mainly because of the powerful querying tools and languages that databases offered to incorporate new knowledge. But the visual medical knowledge remained significantly outside of the field of databases, even while the most extensive public database of the Visible Human Dataset became a reality. However, when it became clear that even this was not enough to overcome the barriers to balanced complementarity between those in different professional healthcare roles, I turned towards multigenerational family environments as a way to both serve and protect patients by working on standards and process modelling for eHealth that would include better governance in the National Healthcare System of my country. This pathway accounts for travelling some 45 years of my life, though now I sometimes feel somewhat of a heretic when we are asked to fight against fake news in medical fields. To summarize projects involved in my many navigations: The electrocardiomultigraphimeter ECXGM. Implemented on a Commodore 64 CPU with peripherals adding just a few electrodes, we showed how IT can improve medical devices almost instantly, adding large data storage, enabling time series analysis of vital signs. Shortly afterwards, the medical instrumentation industry reacted, incorporating embedded digital chips. Along this line, I was an advisor to Adolfo Castelli, one of the owners of the company that manufactured the Cardioline device. In some sense, ECXGM might appear to be an ancestor of Big Data and Clouds Clinical Care apps. Databases for Cardiology. Supported by Bayer Italia we developed software for data management of ambulatory cardiology and hypertensive patients. It was given to more than fifty cardiology departments in Italian Hospitals under ANMCO - the largest Italian association of clinical cardiologists. They were distributed free, but only after prospective users had attended a full-time training course, delivered by a Travelling Informatics Teaching Classroom, consisting of some twenty-four portable PCs. A drug- to-drug interaction package was included, a minimum data set indicated, with the strategic intent of encouraging clinical departments to cooperate so as to rapidly acquire the patient data needed for determining the statistical relevance of clinical hypotheses. Having asked too much of clinical departments that were not as yet ready to publish their collaborations in the top scientific cardiology literature, the program had to be interrupted. Later on, however, ANMCO directly launched its own successful GISSI program. Visible Human Dataset \u2013 Milano Mirror Site (VHD-MMS). Sometimes numbers help us appreciate the incredible jumps in technological evolution. In 1995 it took days to download images of the heart slices from the NLM/NIH servers because Internet connections to Europe were so slow. When I asked for 55 G of memory for opening the Milano Mirror Site for the Visible Human Dataset, Mauro Santomauro, in charge of Academic IT, said to me: \u201cFrancesco, the entire Politecnico runs with 12 G, and you are just one Professor!\u201d This led Mauro and me to ask Antonio Cantore, director of the CILEA Inter-university Consortium for Information and Communication Technology (nine universities of the Lombardia Region), for help. Thanks to private companies sponsoring the initiative, the VHD-MMS opened in 1997 to serve European researchers interested in accessing and downloading the digital anatomy data. Michael Ackerman of the NLM was immensely helpful. The cost of the mirror site server system was around 250 million lire (roughly 125,000 \u20ac today), in contrast to the present 100 \u20ac cost of a 64G USB pen drive. The Historia Medica Familiae Digital suite. In the summer of 2008, we loaded on YouTube the visual user-manual or a web-based system for a  Family Health Record. Anticipating the National Healthcare Service\u2019s eventual coordination of clinical data, we designed a multigenerational family prototype database for storing documents (HMFD). HMFD could become the distal branch of a Digital National Healthcare System, once its Health Record management system is in place and available to citizens. One-shot graphical ID for Medical Apps. As medical apps become increasingly ubiquitous, universities have a role to play in helping the often-unprepared and frequently-na\u00efve users. Producing reliable up-to-date reviews for the many changeable medical apps, and not expecting well-established standards bodies like ISO and CEN to be timely, we joined a group in IMIA (Claudia Pagliari, Anne Moen and Jana Zvarova) to suggest formats, contents, data modalities and roles for a graphical ID for eHealth. Process Modeling for Healthcare and Clinical Governance. With eHealth for serving national governance in mind, we worked on a comprehensive model to allow representing, comparing, and analysing available systems, and to sustain e-Prescription processes within national healthcare systems. The model can be used for cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness analyses of heterogeneous systems. In the Lombardy Region, my GP prescriptions no longer require a payment from individuals, since, by reading my healthcare card any pharmacy can access my prescription online, and fill it. Regional Healthcare Governance bodies hold the data for longitudinal individual and population group tracking, including anti-fraud analytics. We have also contributed to implementing standards for interoperability among healthcare providers in the public regional Healthcare Information System. Fulvio Barbarito, in his role as Strategic Manager of the Lombardia Informatica public company, has been the key facilitator in developing this approach within the company. Textbooks. I have edited many textbooks, some resulting from often-heated discussions with informatics and computer engineering colleagues, beginning more than forty years ago. They frequently asked me: what makes a textbook in Medical Informatics different from a textbook in Informatics? Their answer was that there was no difference! My answer was that they would differ in illustrative and realistic medical examples. Colleagues who agreed with me have been co-authoring chapters since my first textbook, published by an Italian medical book house in 1981. Various informatics Colleagues wrote foundations and principles chapters, while I provided the medical examples. Many of these remain valid, even while the old informatics solutions have become mostly obsolete. My subsequent textbooks were inspired by the same approach, and I used the same example-grounded approach when John Mantas asked me to join in delivering his EU-funded Master Course in Health Informatics, whose European Faculty went to Athens to deliver the various lesson segments. At my age, I often feel \u201cquiet frustration\u201d in that almost everything I have done has been overcome by innovation. However, in my present life I feel proud to have worked in medical informatics and eHealth, contributing to its evolution, from an academic perspective, joining in founding the Italian Association of Medical Informatics (AIIM) in 1975, whose first President was Armando Tardini, Professor of Pathology at the University of Parma. Today, in 2017, the Bioengineering section of the Italian National Register of University Professors includes more than 220 academics. To summarize my thoughts about the past vs. the present, the evolution of Medical Informatics can be seen from the perspective of applications in research, governance or management, professional participants in practice, and patient or public impact. Research has moved from punched cards to the online web-based digital PubMed world of today. This evolution did not come for free. Among the major tools making this possible, the ones related to languages persist over time. Frequently language enrichment  does not generate short-term returns, but this is a necessary cost that new and deep knowledge carries with it. As for hardware, software and other infrastructure components, increases in processor speeds and memory size have been so dramatic as to have changed all technological assumptions and capabilities. We have moved from \u201cfirst analyse then implement\u201d to \u201cfirst let\u2019s try and then, if successful, let\u2019s go on to understand why\u201d. Most of the present eHealth fields reflect this evolution: from big data to analytics, from editorially-uncontrolled archiving to the rationally-unjustified success of uncertain predictions. We seem to demand novelty in building tools for separating true knowledge from false, yet this happens in environments where access to each is equally fast and simple, and so frequently does not differentiate them well for the un-initiated or non- expert. As for governance, or management, the evolution has gone from what was generally to be analysed by \u201cinstitutes of biomedical statistics\u201d to \u201ca health card that I have in my pocket as one of the about sixty million citizens (in Italy)\u201d. Electronic prescription is the organizational and technological infrastructure allowing e- procurement and traceability, detailed pharma-history of the patient and fraud investigation. To what extent this digital governance contributes to evidence and might increase life expectancy is yet to be seen \u2013 it is under investigation. Nevertheless, it contributes positively to healthcare system management monitoring and control. Among the various major professional participants or actors in the eHealth arena, the individual patient and various cohorts of a population are naturally expected beneficiaries. Today, at the window of a healthcare shop on the street where I live in the outskirts of Milano, I see that that they offer citizens services for keeping healthcare data and documents in good order. Nevertheless, my practical expectations are higher, since, as a taxpayer, my country already makes available to me an almost-for-free service where the many pages and often very complex forms of my annual income declarations are filled in correctly. I believe that the Public Healthcare System ought to make a similar service available to let me update my Patient Summary. Nowadays I perceive the risk that eHealth services worry more about the defensive needs of various institutions rather than caring about individual patients. As a citizen, I am an \u201cold\u201d person, though fortunately still in good health, without major hospitalizations over the past thirty-five years. Nevertheless, for displaying my healthcare data, large tables of data are not enough. Different data types, different originating institutions, different media, present obstacles to patient understanding of their data that we are frequently not able to cope with. What is seriously lacking is an eHealth market segment focused on products oriented towards the multigenerational family. This environment is largely disregarded by eHealth governance to the point that, to respect patients and their privacy as individuals, we run the risk of considering them as social orphans of their families. We have uploaded on YouTube the user manual of a prototype we built in an attempt to overcome this shortcoming. ", "Marjan Premik": "Past Head, Hygiene Social Medicine and Occupational Health Department, Faculty of Medicine, Ljubljana President, Slovenian Medical Informatics Association (1992-2000) Organizer, MIE\u201999 Congress My personal story in the field of health informatics is intertwined with stories of my colleagues and friends with which I have reaped the rewards and shared optimistic feelings regarding the introduction of computer technology in Slovenia\u2019s healthcare. As a dentist, specializing in orthodontics, in addition to M. Premik, DMD, MSc, PhD clinical work, I was enthusiastic about epidemiological studies of the aetiology of dental and oral cavity diseases. In this field, I professionally cooperated with an epidemiologist, Dr. Mayer Vladimir, who helped me to learn about data sources, their paths and their public health meanings. At that time, health services worked as an entirely public service in Slovenia\u2014one of the six Yugoslav republics. A classic and quite comprehensive reporting system was established. Due to the slowness and difficulties of data updating in the classic system, mainly in the area of invoicing for healthcare services, the Celje Regional Health Centre, where I was employed, started to introduce automatic data processing in 1971. In the beginning, instead of only using a computer for issuing invoices, we introduced a system, which would later be capable of integrated processing of data relevant for issuing invoices, as well as for health and financial statistics. The introduction demanded numerous technological, organizational and managerial changes. I participated in implementing these changes as an enthusiastic supporter of automatic data processing with some basic knowledge of computers, which I obtained through courses, organized by IBM. The director of the Celje Regional Health Centre, senior doctor Anton Fazarinc, became the Minister of Health of the Republic in 1973. He invited me to the ministry, with others, to help him develop a health information system at the of the level Republic. I accepted the invitation and as an Advisor to the Minister, I led the Republic\u2019s Expert Commission, which was established in 1974 and was responsible for the coordination of efforts in the field of building a unique health information system. The Commission conducted a research study (1974) which gave us the insight regarding human resources, software, applications and developmental aspirations in the field of automatic data processing in various healthcare institutions. We discovered that only few healthcare institutions were processing data with office computers and that they only had peripheral software in these early stages of introduction, while most data processing was done by larger computer centres outside of healthcare. It appeared that informatics in Slovenia was falling behind general development of healthcare, systemic and institutionalized coordination was lacking, there were no methodological and technological examples for the planning of a complex multi-institutional information system, and the demands for managerial and expert information were increasing. We were mainly getting our experience with the introduction of computer data processing from services in information processing at the Celje level, called \u201cAutomatic Prescription Processing\u201d. Franc Ko\u0161ir led this joint project and it included all issued  prescriptions on primary and specialist level of healthcare service (approximately 10 million per year). The Expert Commission supported the project in terms of expertise and political influence, and it was up and running in 1974. Based on the information from this project, two important public health successes were achieved: (i) lowering the costs of medications, and (ii) changing professional guidelines for prescribing medicines. Based on the findings, experiences and general expectations, the Expert Commission started to prepare proposals for the introduction of a common computer system in Slovenia: starting points, legal bases, technological organizational guidelines, potential financial and human resources and planning of developmental terms. Based on these bases, we prepared a project, entitled \u201cComputer-supported health information system in the Socialist Republic of Slovenia\u201d and proposed it for implementation as part of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). We submitted the project proposal to the Republic\u2019s government, which forwarded it to the federal government for approval. We received confirmation of the proposal on 10th November 1980 and I was named the project director in an agreement between the Yugoslav government and the UNDP. This was a multidisciplinary project based on the work of four professional and technological expert sub-groups - automatic processing, databases, economics and legislation. The activities were implemented in the selected different types of healthcare organizations, and were coordinated by a central national group, composed of representatives from all the professions involved. The WHO named Professor Werner Schneider from Uppsala as the external expert. The objectives of the project were the following: to document and analyse the existing information systems, to prepare a plan for a computer-supported health information system, and to produce an activity plan. We carried out interviews with representatives from primary, specialist, hospital, social-hygienic-epidemiological and health insurance services. We designed a unique approach to note the status of all existing documents and information flows (info graphs \u2013 Jo\u017ee Ga\u0161per\u0161i\u010d). An analysis of regulations and documents for healthcare services and health insurance as well as of their interconnection was carried out. The analysis included the information flow between internal and external information systems (demographics, vital signs, etc.) as well as comparisons with relevant foreign information systems. Based on the findings, we developed models of potential processes and prepared cost estimates for the existing health information system. The results are documented in three publications (Premik et al., 1984a, 1984b, 1988). We have obtained the following information: status of business network, data collections scheme, a scheme of communication between participants, a model of the computer- supported health information system (seven regional centres and the needed software) and estimates of costs for their operation (2.1% of planned expenses of health insurance services\u20140.9% higher than the costs in 1982). Despite economic crises in Yugoslavia, changes in policy-makers, and the transfer of project management to other institutions, we managed to finish the project and keep it relevant, demonstrating its strategical importance as well as contacts with the experts providing guidance to the project. Some institutions in the Slovenian healthcare system have upgraded their information systems based on the project\u2019s results. This is true mainly for health insurance services and pharmacy services. Pharmacies were the first to organize their businesses entirely with the help of computer technology. The health insurance institute used the UNDP project results as a professional foundation for setting up the current informational infrastructure of data banks of users, data banks of health care workers,  data banks of compulsory payers and data banks of organisational units in the health care system; and the introduction of a personal health card in Slovenia. An example of team operation established in the UNDP project, is the computer-supported implementation of a large-scale epidemiological research on the dental/oral health of schoolchildren in Slovenia in 1984, covering 120,808 children. One of the most important indirect results from the UNDP project was the establishment of the Slovene Medical Informatics Association (SDMI). The project collaborators Fazarinc Anton, Ko\u0161ir Franc, Premik Marjan, Ratkajc Ivo, and Adami\u010d \u0160. spread over different occupations, saw the need for expert cooperation and helped found the association. As one of the godfathers of the association, I was elected its vice president (1988-1992), and later its president (1992-2000), organizing the European Congress \u2013 MIE\u201999 in Ljubljana. Today, I am proud to be an honorary member of SDMI. Journal of Health Philosophy and Policy, 1998; 6:59-64 ", "Alan Rector": "Professor (Emeritus) of Medical Informatics, School of Computer Science, University of Manchester, UK Although it peaked early in a summer school during high school, my interest in computers lay largely dormant through an undergraduate degree of Philosophy and Mathematics. However, it did provide a background in foundations of mathematics and logic that was to prove invaluable. When I began medical school at the University of Chicago in 1968, I found myself one of the few people who knew anything about computing. I leveraged my A. Rector, MD minimal knowledge, first on a summer project extending the print layout of certain SPSS functions, and then on a rather ambitious language generation project for X-Ray reports on an early IBM 360. This was in the early days of carrying boxes of cards home from the computing centre at 3:00am. In parallel I began reading many things on computing and Artificial Intelligence\u2014 Feigenbaum\u2019s Computers and Thought , Minsky & Papert\u2019s Perceptrons , and Knuth\u2019s Art of Computer Programming, plus anything I could find. My real entry to Medical Informatics came when I moved for my final two clinical years to the University of Minnesota and met Gene Ackerman, La\u00ebl Gatewood, and the Medical Computing Centre team there. They introduced me to Ledley and Lusted\u2019s work on Bayesian diagnosis. In an extended elective, I managed to produce, with their help, a program to select the optimal ordering for questions in a diagnostic questionnaire based on minimizing expected entropy over a Bayesian analysis of the potential updates to the diagnostic probabilities. They also sponsored a visit to an early SCAMC meeting and provided the space to audit lectures in AI in the Department of Psychology and be lucky enough to attend the Feyerabend-Lakatos travelling debates on the philosophy of science when they came through Minneapolis. The issues between the Kuhnian (Feyerabend) and Popperian (Lakatos) views of scientific method echo still in the debates that inform (or plague) discussions of medical terminology. After my internship, I was convinced that medicine was changing and that avoiding medical errors was a matter of organisational learning rather than just individual responsibly\u2014a view heavily influenced by seeing two of my colleagues repeat fatal errors that others had made before them and have occurred repeatedly since. There but for the grace of God\u2026 Given my interests, increased use of computers seemed the natural means to help systematize critical aspects of medical practice. I intended to pursue a PhD in Medical Informatics at Minnesota with my residency, but first arranged a fellowship with Tim de Dombal in Leeds, England, a leading expert on Bayesian computer aided diagnosis. Although I had intended to return to the US, my wife and I were both offered positions at the University of Nottingham. I spent the next few years in the Department of Community Medicine under Professor Maurice Backett, a polymath who had developed a department spanning General Practice, Public Health, Epidemiology, Medical Psychology and Sociology, and, with my arrival, Medical Informatics. I worked primarily with David Metcalfe, professor of General Practice and then his successor  Mike Sheldon. We first produced a survey of work on medical information systems in the UK for the Kings Fund, which also contributed to a book co-authored with Joan Zimmerman on an early survey of clinical informatics more widely. The grants supported our development of a system for diagnostic and treatment registers. It was a time of rapid development of General Practice systems in the UK led by the British Computer Society Primary Healthcare Specialist Group - a history documented by Hayes and Barnett. In the UK, the response to the Japanese Fifth Generation Computer Project had been the Alvey Project, a major research effort in AI. As part of the Alvey project, the Medical Research Council supported the IMMEDIATE project\u2014an ambitious multidisciplinary effort to determine the most common problematic decisions in General Practice and develop small expert systems for them. The original conception was of a collection of small expert systems for diagnosis and management systems of key problems in General practice. The interaction of the GPs and social scientists on the project much influenced by my psychologist wife Peggy Newton, resulted in the realisation that this was woefully na\u00efve, both in terms of GP\u2019s needs and the existing computing technology. One outcome was a conference and book on decision making in general practice. The other was to switch from the then fashionable \u201coracular\u201d expert systems in favour of intelligent information presentation and data entry\u2014an approach motivating the rest of my career. On Morris Backett\u2019s retirement, the Department in Nottingham broke up. David Metcalfe moved to Manchester, and I followed a few years later, first to a joint appointment with the Faculty of Medicine, and then to the Department of Computer Science, where we were lucky enough to establish quickly a medical informatics group with Stephen Kay, Carole Goble, Trevor Howkins and myself with close associations to David\u2019s Department of General Practice. Once established in the Medical Informatics Group with the link to General Practice, we had a sound foundation for a project for the user-centred design of next generation GP systems - the PEN&PAD project, jointly supported by the Medical Research Council and the Department of Health. We were remarkably lucky in the team we recruited, particularly Anthony Nowlan\u2014who provided clinical expertise and was also a talented programmer, largely responsible for implementing the GRAIL language\u2014Bernard Horan, an expert in user centred design, and the psychologist consultants Mike Fitter and Bob Garber. Visual interfaces and mice were operational in the late 1980\u2019s. The approach was heavily influenced by the work on human-centred design coming both from the US (Winograd, 1996) and Scandinavia (Ehn, 1993) (Timpka, 1987). The project used rapid prototyping and repeated workshops with GPs and actors to simulate patients to test and revise the designs. Bernard Horan\u2019s choice of Smalltalk as an implementation language allowed rapid prototyping cycles on a scale of weeks or months rather than years. The experience was exciting but exhausting. Time and again, the team implemented the features they thought the doctors had asked for only to have them reject them at the next workshop. Despite, or thanks to this \u201ctaking getting beat over the head lessons\u201d the results were spectacular. The process has never been fully published, although partial descriptions can be found in (Rector et al., 1992) and (Horan et al., 1990). The project also gave rise to an object-oriented view of medical records. What became the GRAIL language was developed to support the need for an intelligent adaptive interface that could suggest what it was \u201csensible to say\u201d according to circumstances\u2014i.e. the relevant terminology. In today\u2019s terms, GRAIL combined features of frame and description logic ++ systems. In practice, the description logic component was almost identical to EL /OWL- EL\u2014the maximal computationally tractable subset of description logic. The frame-like component consisted of \u201csensible\u201d statements that allowed authors to state what  expressions would make sense analogous to frame systems (referred to as \u201csanctioning\u201d), plus a set of operations on annotations (known as \u201cextrinsics\u201d) designed to allow the description logic ontology to act as a framework for other information and to simulate defaults with exceptions. (Alternatively, GRAIL\u2019s \u201csensible statements\u201d can be compared to canonical graphics in Sowa\u2019s Conceptual Graph formalism. The PEN&PAD gave rise to a commercial product in cooperation with one of the then main suppliers of GP systems in the UK (VAMP Health), but fell victim to changes when the company was taken over near the end of the project. It survived as an independent company developing a generic front-end for GP systems when UK policy delayed procurement of new GP systems, and the company\u2019s resources were insufficient to establish new markets. The best-known outcome of PEN&PAD was the GALEN project and its successors on clinical terminology funded by the European Commission under the Framework program. GALEN pioneered the use of description logics for medical terminologies\u2014what would now be called \u201contologies\u201d. It\u2019s most important contribution, sadly not followed by others in the field, was to develop a user-friendly \u201cintermediate representation\u201d that made it relatively easy for domain experts to express concepts correctly according to its conventions without having to understand the details of the GRAIL language or the GALEN high level ontology. The ontology development and quality assurance were directed by Jeremy Rogers. Its most successful application was its use under Jean Marie Rodrigues in the development of the French national terminology for procedures. The combination of intermediate representation and carefully monitoring, both before and after classification, established a level of quality assurance that, arguably, has not subsequently been equalled. The resulting ontology of roughly 100,000 concepts is still available at www.opengalen.org. However, it was effectively superseded by the collaboration of the Read Code organisation in the UK and SNOMED RT to develop SNOMED CT, although its resources continued to be used. A sadly missed opportunity in the early 1990s, near the beginning of the GALEN programme, was the Canon initiative and the work of David Evans on combining linguistic with semantic, concept-based methods for medical terminology (Cimino, 1994). The National Library of Medicine chose to support only lexical and linguistic methods largely ignoring even the combined methods advocated by Evans. Without Evans\u2019 vision of integrated linguistic and concept-based tools, the division between the two approaches has not been bridged. Without support for open-source initiatives for concept-based representations in the US, it was left to the College of American Pathologists Organisation to develop a closed system, SNOMED CT, for which, at least internationally, intellectual property issues are major barriers to use and development. The late 1990s saw the rise of the Semantic Web. One of my PhD students, Ian Horrocks, now professor at Oxford, took the success of GRAIL and GALEN\u2019s largely heuristic classifier as a challenge to work on optimising main stream complete and decidable description logic classifiers, leading to the FaCT++, which produced an improvement of five orders of magnitude in their performance on a variant of GALEN\u2019s ontology. This \u201cnot.galen\u201d (http://protege.cim3.net/file/work/ontologies/not.galen/)\u2014 remains an important benchmark testing tool in the description logic community, and led directly to the Web Ontology Language (OWL) of Horrocks. Although I did not participate directly in the development of the OWL standard, I spent the next several years understanding and experimenting with OWL in both medical and biomedical fields. The most important outcomes were the Prot\u00e9g\u00e9-OWL environment, developed in collaboration with the Biomedical Computing Centre at Stanford University, a series of documentation and tutorials on OWL, and the  Manchester OWL Syntax all of which have become de facto standards. In the meantime, my colleagues Carole Goble and Robert Stevens pioneered the use of the Semantic Web and OWL for bioinformatics\u2014a field rapidly attracting many of the best IT researchers and where the complexities of clinical care and medical tradition posed fewer barriers. The clinical promise of these developments was carried forward both in an academic and in commercial collaborations. The academic collaboration\u2014the Clinical E-Science Framework\u2014was a collaboration of linguists and OpenEHR and Archetype developments. Despite the high quality scientific outputs, the project never reached its full potential because of privacy considerations over access to medical records corpora for text processing and the re-organisation of the IT department at the primary collaborating centre under the English National Programme for IT. A separate collaboration with a small IT company in Glasgow, Clinical Informatics Ltd, proved more successful. It led to embedding the technology in their software for anaesthesia pre- assessment questionnaires. A long-term collaboration with Siemens Health in the US further developed the ideas in an increasingly demanding commercial context. In parallel with these developments, I began working with the WHO on the development of a radically new architecture for ICD-11 that would include an Ontological Component, hopefully to be harmonised with SNOMED CT. The technical problems have been largely solved; whether the political and intellectual property issues can be solved remains to be seen. In each of the three projects\u2014one academic, two commercial\u2014we attempted to use the SNOMED CT logical formulation and hierarchies in decision support systems met with surprising difficulties and errors which caused them to be summarily rejected by the collaborating clinicians. The WHO-IHTSDO collaboration also turned up surprising anomalies. This puzzled me deeply, as SNOMED CT was based on a formal description logic representation that should have made such errors unlikely to occur in the first place, easy to search for, and liable to systematic correction when found. Indeed, some of SNOMED\u2019s founders had published a paper on a suitable methodology. Fortunately, Kent Spackman had produced a transformation of the SNOMED files into OWL which allowed me to use the tools we had already developed, especially Luigi Ianonne\u2019s Ontology Pre Processor Language (OPPL), to apply these and other methods to the analysis of a sample of SNOMED. A series of papers identified egregious errors in SNOMED CT and detailed the methodology we used both to identify errors and to trace them to their root cause. The SNOMED staff indicate that some of these errors have been rectified and others await the implementation of a revised model of anatomy. Which leaves a question mark remaining over the what has become the main thrust of a research programme originally intended to address issues of clinical care, electronic health records and decision support\u2014whether or not there will be a terminology sufficiently usable, quality assured, widely accepted, and widely available to support such a programme. ", "Assa Reichert (1943 \u2013 2015)": "By George Mihalas & Rolf Engelbrecht Assa Reichert received his BA in Life Sciences, and an MA in Life Science and Computer Science from Bar-Ilan University in Israel. He started his career as assistant director of the well- known Sheba Medical Center, continued as vice- president of COMET, an Israeli-American software company for healthcare management and EHR software, and then became director of the first computer department in the Israeli Ministry of Health. His professional experience led him to other leadership positions: vice-president and chief marketing officer of Sarel Logistics Solutions & Products for Advanced Medicine Ltd in 1995, and then, in 2006 \u2013 executive vice-president at HealSis Ltd. In the last years of his life he acted as a consultant to the Ministry of Health on Healthcare Information Management. In 1993 Reichert was appointed by ILAMI (Israeli Association of Medical Informatics), as chair of the Local Organizing Committee of MIE 1993, held in Israel. After the success of this conference, from 1994, he became the representative of ILAMI to EFMI \u2013 the European Federation for Medical Informatics. He was elected secretary of EFMI in 1998, vice-president for EFMI Working Groups in 2000 and became EFMI President for the period 2002-2004, followed by the position as IMIA Vice-President for Europe for 2004\u20132006. He was one of the most active members of the EFMI Board. He strongly supported Rolf Engelbrecht\u2019s proposal to start a second sequence of annual conferences by EFMI - the SPC\u2019s or Special Topic Conferences - inagurated in 2001 with the first meeting in Bucharest, entitled \u201cHealthcare Telematics in Transition Countries\u201d. This was one of the first EFMI events to take place in Eastern Europe. He was the chair of the Scientific Programme Committee of another STC in Eastern Europe in 2006. This was held in Timisoara, Romania: \u201cIntegrating Biomedical Information: from e-Cell to e-Patient\u201d. He continued to be a member of the EFMI Board. In 2006 he assumed the position of officer for institutional members, then becoming the chair of the Audit Committee from 2012 and chair of the Ethics Committee from 2014. In recognition of his outstanding contributions he was elected an EFMI Honorary Fellow in 2010. Summarizing Assa\u2019s activities with the simple listing of his professional positions as in the paragraph above, does not reveal the full personality of Assa Reichert, who was perhaps the most influential person on the EFMI Council for almost two decades. He was the person whose words were always most carefully considered, the person able to maintain a well balanced atmosphere in difficult moments, the person deeply respected by his colleagues. Those that remain most vivid in the memory of his colleagues in EFMI are his outstanding speech at MIE 2009 in Sarajevo, calling for unity, understanding and closer collaboration between scientists from different parts of Europe and also his vision about the importance of a Code of Ethics and the role of the EFMI Ethics Committee. All these activities and positions expressed on different occasions clearly show how Assa Reichert was indeed one of the most distinctive and prominent personalties of European medical informatics. ", "Peter Leo Reichertz (1920 \u2013 1987)": "By Jochen Moehr Introduction: 1960s \u2013 Evolution of a new paradigm. Throughout much of Central Europe, the 1960s were a time of fermenting new ideas, which by the end of the decade led to a militant revolt of the younger generation against the established authorities. Influences ranged from Mao Zedong\u2019s Cultural Revolution in China to a dissatisfaction with the way the legacy of the Nazi era\u2014the so-called Empire of a thousand years\u2014was dealt with in Germany. In November 1967, during the ceremony for the Inauguration of the Rector of the University of Hamburg, student leaders unrolled a transparency reading \u201cUnter den Talaren der Muff von 1000 Jahren\u201d\u2014freely translated: \u201cUnder the gowns, the staleness of a 1000 years\u201d. Within two years, wearing of gowns during ceremonies was abandoned at all German Universities. However, during this era of unquestioned trust in science and technology, and with a background of solidified economic prosperity, there were also very constructive new ideas at work. For instance, Fritz Hartmann, since 1956 at age 36 the youngest full professor to hold a chair in Internal Medicine in Germany, started to work in 1961 on a concept for a new medical academy in the context of an effort to significantly expand the educational opportunities for physicians in Germany. This new institution\u2014the Medizinische Hochschule Hannover (MHH) (Hanover Medical School)\u2014was designed to integrate patient care with research and education, offering a strikingly different structure than those traditional in German medical faculties. Rather than consisting of a federation of little fiefdoms of different medical specialties\u2014 each equipped with its own patient care facilities, administration, laboratories, libraries, research labs, etc., the new facility was to use centralized facilities for patient wards, administration, patient examination, operating facilities, and was to be surrounded by supporting institutions for ancillary disciplines, such as pharmacy, pathology, biomedical engineering, etc. Importantly, there was envisioned a central archive for all medical records, including radiographs and products of other imaging devices, and everything was to be sorted by patient identifier, so that all documents pertaining to a given patient were kept in one place. The different components of the MHH were to be linked by pneumatic tube and conveyor belt systems, telephones and\u2014eventually an electronic information system. From its early planning stages, the MHH was to include an \u201cAbteilung Medizinische Dokumentation\u201d (Division of Medical Documentation), with 2 120m allocated for this with an office for the Director, which included a couch and a shower. The justification for this was that the Director would probably be an elderly gentleman, who would appreciate being able to rid him self of the dust of the files, and who then needed a nap after lunch! Even a bit of support for data processing equipment was envisioned, such as a Hollerith card sorting machine or even a Zuse Z3!  All this changed radically in 1969, when Dr. Peter Reichertz was offered the position of Professor and Director of what was now termed the \u201cAbteilung Medizinische Dokumentation und Datenverarbeitung\u201d (Division of Medical Documentation and Data Processing). The author was at that time resident physician in Dr. Fritz Hartmann\u2019s Department of Internal Medicine at the MHH and had for a while developed an interest in exploring the brave new world of computers. In pursuit of this interest, he had registered with some 100 other students at the Technical University of Hannover for an Introduction to the programming language Algol. This lecture consisted essentially of a listing of the elements of Algol in Bakkus-Naur notation. Lectures took place once a week, and that was the opportunity to receive printouts of programming exercises and submit them in the form of punch card decks. This process was so clumsy that it took over three months before the author\u2019s one and only Algol program executed successfully. At the same time, right after arriving in Hannover, Dr. Reichertz, had offered an introduction to PL/1, a vastly more versatile programming language. Rather than emphasizing the syntax, he presented problems and offered algorithmic solutions, progressing from simple examples to increasingly sophisticated solutions. Renting machine time from IBM, the three initial students\u2014all medical doctors\u2014were able to have interesting programs running within days. The contrast to what was going on at the Technical University could not have been greater. Beyond that, our excitement was enhanced by Reichertz displaying his comprehensive vision and plans for his support of MHH through data processing, and for the new field in general, which he suggested would be called \u201cMedizinische Informatik\u201d or \u201cMedical Informatics\u201d. That was in November 1969. In early 1970, the author decided to join Dr. Reichertz in his newly established division. The title of the division was soon changed to \u201cKlinische Informatik\u201d (Clinical Informatics). But Dr. Reichertz, keen to avoid being boxed into a service role to the hospital, sought and pursued responsibility for the entire field of health care with a name change, which in 1974 finally resulted in \u201cAbteilung Medizinische Informatik\u201d (Division of Medical Informatics). 1970s: Early breakthroughs. The Medical System Hannover (MSH): During the summer of 1970, Dr. Reichertz moved into the new premises with a staff of some 20 people, including seven academics from several disciplines besides medicine. The 2 institutional space now exceeded 1200m \u2013 ten times the original allocation. Of this, 350 2 m were allocated to a computer room housing an IBM 360/67 with a value rumored to be on the order of 12M German Marks\u2014currently over 50M Euros - a huge leap beyond the originally envisioned data processing. In those days, this was the most powerful computer in any hospital computing center in Germany, and the country only had four other University hospitals with computing centers at the time. By current capabilities, this machine had a ridiculously tiny CPU of 256Kbyte in the form of magnetic core storage. However, together with some 233 MB of direct access storage in the form of disk stacks, which filled a large wall of the computer room, and a then revolutionary operating system, the control Program 67, or CP67, it was possible to simultaneously configure and operate many virtual machines. Reichertz saw the implementation of a centralized information and communication system for the MHH as the core of his responsibilities. This he called the \u201cMedical System Hannover\u201d, MSH (Figure 1). He envisioned a number of interacting sub-systems grouped around the central functions of process support for both the clinical and  Figure 1. The overall scheme for the Medical System Hannover, MSH, as an integrated hospital information system. administrative domains, which further interacted with stand-alone systems for the theoretical institutes and research labs. This vision\u2014which was refined and further detailed over the years\u2014did not only match admirably the revolutionary integrated concept of the MHH, as a new kind of medical school, but it served as a goal post and guide for the staff of soon to-be 80 co-workers from a wide range of academic disciplines, including mathematicians, informaticians (i.e., computer scientists), physicists, electrical and mechanical engineers, medical and veterinary doctors and even an economist. The systems created in the division of Dr. Reichertz were complemented with commercial systems for patient billing, personnel and payroll management, and the control of supply stocks for the hospital administration, as well as systems for bio-signal processing, laboratory processing, free text analysis in support of clinical processes, and research in different divisions and departments. Even if not all of these systems were housed in the division of Dr. Reichertz, they were increasingly integrated with each other. Within two or three years, a prototype of an Integrated Hospital Information System had been created which was way ahead of what was achievable in practice at the time, a system, which would to this day be met with respect and admiration. Just one example of the unique success of what Reichertz implemented is the following: through integration of ordering of drugs on the wards with the stock control and financial bookkeeping, it already became possible in 1974 to inform the chiefs of medical services of the financial implications of drug therapy on the wards under their control. That was previously unavailable information. Within three months of introduction of this system, the amount of money spent for drug therapy at the MHH was reduced by some 20%. This translated into savings of approximately 1.2M German Marks annually, which was more than the annual budget of the entire  division of Dr. Reichertz. This system, created by Dr. G. Laude in the context of his dissertation, was one of the most enduring systems from the times of Dr. Reichertz. Figure 2. Peter L. Reichertz as \u201cComputer Doctor\u201d Despite such spectacular successes\u2014and there were many others\u2014it was not always easy to convince the administration of the benefits of such a phenomenally expensive computer and its huge support staff in a hospital environment. Dr. Reichertz had to stay constantly active promoting the value Medical Informatics to the general public. This led to public relations contortions, such as Dr. Reichertz photographed standing near the huge tape drives of the time, wearing a doctor\u2019s white coat, deeply engrossed in reading some of the hundreds of pages output by the high-speed printer, with the a stethoscope draped around his neck\u2014an indispensable symbolism when working with computers in medicine! (Figure 2). I love this photo but have been unable to find a better version to include here. Early on, Dr. Reichertz developed a demonstration version of the MSH, which he took on promotional travels around the world. This encouraged a steadily increasing stream of visitors requiring two full time staff to organize visits so that the guests could get the information they were after, and the rest of the staff could fulfill their regular duties. Other scientific accomplishments. In accordance with his broad vision for \u201cMedical Informatics\u201d, Reichertz invested in research beyond the immediate support of Hannover Medical School. For instance, we had started in 1971 to collaborate with General Practitioners in the region. Initial investigations showed clearly that these practitioners did NOT require diagnostic decision support, as was a prevalent assumption at the time, and when entire institutions had been created with the mission to develop diagnostic decision support.  Instead they needed administrative support with patient scheduling, documentation, billing and prescriptions. This collaboration led to a comprehensive analysis of practice characteristics in which well over 50% of the practitioners in the region participated. Dr. Uwe Feldmann carried out a factor analysis of the collected data, clustering them into eight types of practice. This enabled us to formulate hypotheses about which type of practice would benefit from what kind of computer support. These hypotheses were then tested in a field trial of computer support for doctor\u2019s offices, which to our surprise showed that our hypotheses had to be corrected. The resulting paper, published in 1979 (Reichertz P. M.-H., 1979), was 20 years later included in a selection of the most important papers of the previous 30 years in the 1999 Yearbook of Medical Informatics. Reichertz did not compromise in pursuing whatever he started to the highest level of perfection he could achieve. In the early seventies, he qualified for a private pilot licence, which he soon upgraded to a professional pilot licence. Thus equipped, he established an aerospace medical examination unit at MHH, where he tested Lufthansa pilots for airworthiness. Reichertz never spared himself, often working very late hours, sometimes around the clock, which may have contributed to his succumbing to severe illness, aged only 57, in 1987. Work in Learned Societies. Dr. Reichertz had long been very active with various professional learned societies, both in Germany and internationally. In 1970, he was a founding member and later Vice President of \u201cSalutis Unitas\u201d, an elite group of medical informaticians including Paul Hall of Sweden, John Anderson of the U.K., and Carlos Balbona and Morris Collen of the U.S.A. From 1970 to 1977, he was a member of the scientific advisory board of the Conventions on Medical Data Processing in Toulouse, France, and from 1971 to 1980 was also a member of the scientific advisory committee for the Medis Conventions in Japan. From 1977 to 1979, he served as German Representative of the Technical Committee 4 of the International Federation for Information Processing, IFIP TC4, the predecessor organization of IMIA, of which he was also a founding member. We also owe the IMIA logo, adopted in 1980, to him. From 1977 to 1981, he was founding member and first President of the European Federation of Medical Informatics (EFMI), and then served as its Vice-President until 1983. He was very influential in the pertinent scientific societies in Germany, the \u201cGesellschaft f\u00fcr Medizinische Dokumentation, Informatik und Statistik (GMDS)\u201d (Society for Medical Documentation, Informatics and Statistics) as well as the \u201cGesellschaft f\u00fcr Informatik (GI)\u201d \u2013 the German scientific society for Informatics \u2013 or Computer Science. In both these organizations he served in various functions as a high- level officer, including the Presidency of GMDS and as member of the board of GI. In both organizations, he led many important initiatives. One of these was the founding of a \u201cFachbereich Medizinische Informatik\u201d within GMDS, which comprised a number of special working groups such as for laboratory data processing, bio-signal processing, free-text analysis, etc., each of which served as a panel for the advancement of these various areas for scientists from across the country. Education. One of these subgroups (\u201cAus- Fort- und Weiterbildung\u201d) focused on education. It started its work in 1970, and this may have been the earliest initiative of its kind in the world. It was led by a variety of colleagues, but Peter Reichertz was doubtlessly its most forceful and effective leader. It is solely to the credit of Reichertz  that already in 1973, he managed to get a group of academics from both GMDS and GI together in the most pleasant conference site at Reisensburg above the Danube, where three days of intense effort produced a framework for education in Medical Informatics. This framework defined the educational goals in Germany for many years, and influenced other curricular activities internationally. The collaboration between GMDS and GI led to another important milestone: an \u201cAdvanced course on Informatics and Medicine\u201d offered in English for the first time in Hannover in 1975 with many international scholars in attendance serving as lecturers as well as students. The proceedings of this event resulted in an early textbook. His own teaching did not end with courses and seminars on programming approaches, systems analysis and evaluation in Hannover, but from 1975 onward included a track of lectures delivered in the Department of Computer Science of the Technical University of Braunschweig. Beyond that, he was always generous in supporting presentations of his co-workers at scientific conferences, and\u2014often extensive\u2014sojourns of his senior co-workers at prominent institutions around the world. This emphasis on education and support of his co-workers contributed strongly to what may be his most enduring legacy: many of his co-workers and disciples became leaders in academia and international associations for Medical Informatics. This assessment is endorsed by a parting note of Peter Reichertz, written on a copy of a list of his publications: \u201cIch w\u00fcrde mich freuen wenn mein wissenschaftliches Werk von meinen Sch\u00fclern fortgestzt w\u00fcrde.\u201d (I would enjoy if my scientific oeuvre was continued by my disciples). Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, 1987; 25:89-101  Chair of Medical Informatics, University of Gottingen (1994 \u2013 2019) Chair of Medical Informatics, University of Marburg (1984 \u2013 1994) President of GMDS (1993 \u2013 1995) President of IMIA (1995 \u2013 1998) I was born in Dortmund in 1949. My father was a highly regarded internist, while my mother came from a family which had built up a big transportation services business interlinked with the coal and steel industry of the Ruhr area. My father\u00b4s family had turned from farming to academia a generation earlier. William, the first physician in the family, emigrated to America. For two generations both the German and the American branches of the family had mainly followed different professional paths in the healthcare sector. My father\u2019s sister Elfriede Rienhoff was one of the first women in Germany to earn a PhD in Mathematics. I studied medicine at the University of Munster in the late sixties, learning about the medical computing projects there and gaining some experience with them. With the support of my American relatives, in 1972 I was able to benefit from practical training at the computing centers of the Johns Hopkins Medical School in Baltimore, and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. My MD Thesis in 1973 addressed the field of automatic ECG analysis. Because of this, when I searched for an academic fellowship position in Germany, it was for one that would allow me to extend my medical computing skills. At the newly built and innovative Hanover Medical School, I then continued my training as a physician in close collaboration with Peter L. Reichertz, who had returned from the Missouri Medical Computing group led by Donald Lindberg to Hanover. CDSS \u2013ODARS was my first job before I participated in building up the first German cardiological database. With all the great opportunities in Hanover, Reichertz encouraged my international interests and over the years I got to know and participate in international medical informatics. Together with F. Gremy, Reichertz strongly argued for the use of the term Medical Informatics as being a concept with wider coverage than those of medical documentation or medical computing. In 1982, I became Assistant Professor of Medical Informatics, and in 1983/84 a \u201cclause 18 visitor\u201d at the Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town \u2013 focusing on how to overcome some problems involving the hospital software solution, which was adapted from the Stockholm County System in Sweden. Later I studied similar issues arising at the Hospital das Clinicas in Sao Paulo. These tasks led me to become deeply involved with the national medical informatics societies in South Africa and Brazil. From 1984 to 1994, I held the Chair of Medical Informatics at Marburg University and built up a new Institute at the Medical School there \u2013 at that time linking an academic group, the hospital computer center, and a technical computer lab for the use of the recently developed personal computers, and, subsequently the networking arising with the development of the internet. In 1994, I was appointed to a similar position at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, where separating the academic group and the hospital computing center and its networking infrastructure was already underway. I took over from the pioneer Carl Theo Ehlers, who had established one of the three big centers in  Germany. With a staff of more than eighty he had built up a legacy hospital system in Germany. In 2003, the two groups were finally separated. In 2019, I passed the research institute on to Dagmar Krefting \u2013 it had grown to include four Professorships and a research and teaching team of more than 50 persons. Since 2010, the institute has been focusing on building up research data centers for medical research. Because of my early start in Germany, I have been most fortunate in getting to know nearly all the pioneers of our field from the first generation starting with digital data as early as the 1930s with Hollerith machines and punch cards. However, there has been no continuity \u2013 many institutions and working groups were closed down after the pioneers left or retired because both clinicians and administrators remained extremely skeptical. Because of my early international activities, I had many chances to work in health care systems of other countries around the world \u2013 specifically by building up the IMIA WG 9 for developing countries and taking on several advising roles for the World Health Organization in Asia (specifically China) and Latin America and the Caribbean. This was my background for co-chairing a large team writing the first international recommendation on medical informatics for WHO in 1989. These recommendations were widely distributed but never became an official document of WHO due to internal differences. Similar activities brought me into close cooperation with industrial companies who were looking for MI Specialists familiar with the extremely different functionalities of national health care systems throughout the world. In my academic responsibilities I contributed to the development of several new curricula of MI in Germany (Hanover, Braunschweig, G\u00f6ttingen, and most recently for the virtual world of the national MI Initiative). The G\u00f6ttingen MI BSc and MSc curricula were reaccredited by IMIA in 2018. I served as advisor on strategic projects of the German Ministries of Health and Defense in the 1990s, as well as for the European Union. Many results of the work have been published. I served editorially on three book series from Springer and IOS and on Journals as Co-Editor. Regarding academic MI Societies, it was my honor to be President of the National German MI Organization (GMDS) from 1993 -1995 and President of IMIA from 1991 to 1994. In 2013, the joint Science Council of the German Federal Government and its constituent States (Lander) asked me to build up a new organization addressing future aspects of research data management and analysis with their international implications. From 2014 to 2017 I headed this newly established German Council for Scientific Information Infrastructures (RFII). Its recommendation to build up a new overarching research data infrastructure in Germany will be implemented from 2020 onwards. I have been most lucky in my many international learning experiences. Now that I have retired, I plan to summarize them in a book, examining how our field of MI has faced so many difficulties in becoming accepted professionally by the different management levels of healthcare system administration. In this context, what I have learned from my wife Zia and sons Denny and Alexander has been extremely helpful, with their international background regarding new developments of the global financial world of today. The world of medicine and healthcare is an extremely complex environment, with systems influenced nationally by very different and diverse interests and emotions of citizens, patients, healthcare practitioners, and administrators as well as technical personnel. Managing such highly heterogeneous, subjective, and emotionally- charged relationships between individuals and groups drives local and regional developments of medical informatics systems, rather than the more abstract and intellectual concerns that are the focus of the academic world of the MI specialist. ", "Bernard Richards": "FBCS, FIMA, FIHRIM, CEng, CMath, CSci, CITP, FRAMS Professor (Emeritus) of Medical Informatics, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK I obtained a Bachelor\u2019s Degree with Honours in Mathematics and Physics, and a Master\u2019s Thesis entitled \u201cMorphogenesis of Radiolaria\u201d, when working with Alan Turing, while the title of my PhD was \u201cDiffraction in Aplanatic Systems\u201d - work supervised by Emil Wolf, subsequently Professor of Optics at Rochester University in New York. From this latter work a Paper was published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society which has been cited over 750 times, and is still the recognised authority B. Richards, MSc, PhD on the subject, being cited more that 20 times every year since. After my PhD, I spent a time in the Chemical Industry, as a Scientific Officer, managing that Company\u2019s first modern large computer and operating the Company\u2019s \u2018Computer Service\u2019, while solving problems in (a) the Melting of Titanium Ingots, (b) Sagging pipes carrying chemicals, and (c) Distillation Columns. After that, I took up an appointment in the University studying Medicine. I produced the world\u2019s first \u2018Medical Database\u2019 when computerizing all the records for the local Infectious Disease Hospital in 1969. This resulted in the production of the Annual Hospital Report 1970, just 14 days into the New Year: a record previously unheard of. Subsequently, in 1971, I masterminded the computerisation of all mother and baby records in the local Maternity Hospital, some 5,500 deliveries. This was then discovered to be the world\u2019s first \u201cMother and Baby\u201d Database. When I was appointed \u201cProfessor of Medical Informatics\u201d, I was only the second person in the UK to hold this Title. Subsequent to this work on hospital databases, I turned my attention to work on Decision Support (Expert) Systems. I produced an Expert System for control of vital clinical parameters for patients in the Intensive Care Unit in 1976, and an Expert System for Cardio-thoracic Surgery (Open Heart Surgery) in 1977, the first in the world. Since then a further refinement to the Intensive Care System has been produced to control Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, and CVP. This enhanced system worked in hospitals in the UK, Poland, and the Czech Republic. Further databases have been produced in Genetics, Haemophilia, Sickle-cell Disease, and Diabetes. In parallel with the above, Computer-Aided-Learning (CAL) Programmes have been produced for training Student Nurses and Midwives. A Program was made especially for training Physicians to perform a Bronchoscopy. A suite of Programs in Dental Care was also made at the behest of the Regional Dental Officer for use in the Schools in Liverpool. I also produced a Dental-Charting Program way ahead of subsequent commercial systems. I have served on the following committees: NHS Committee on NHS Computer Languages, the RCOG Minimum Dataset Committee, the Intensive Care Computer Group, the Occupational Therapy Society\u2019s Computer Group, the BCS NMSG (as Chairman), the BCS PHCSG, the BCS LMSG, and the BCS Manchester Branch. I also Chaired the BCS Health Informatics Committee for many years, and was Chair of the  Annual Healthcare Computing (HC) Programme Committee, also for many years. In this latter role I was responsible for the many \u2018Healthcare Computing Conferences\u2019, held mainly at Harrogate in the 1990\u2019s. I then chaired the BCS Health (Northern) Committee. I have over 90 publications of which there are 30 publications in medical journals. These areas of research include Infectious Diseases, Gynaecology, Obstetrics, Strokes, Paediatrics, Cardiology, Intensive Care, Gastroenterology, and Infertility. Additionally, a further 30 papers have been given at International Conferences in Medicine and Medical Informatics. I was elected Chairman of the British Computer Society\u2019s \u201cHealth Informatics Committee\u201d, the most senior professional Health Informatics post in the UK. I also became the first President of the Institute of Health Records and Information Management in 1997. In 1998, I was made the British Computer Society\u2019s \u201cFellow of the Year\u201d for services to Medical Informatics. In 1999, I was awarded the Saint Wenceslas Medal of Charles University for \u201cServices to Medicine in Prague\u201d. I have received other international recognition by being made an Honorary Fellow of the Medical Computing Societies of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, the Ukraine, and Poland, and a Fellow of the Romanian Academy of Medical Science. I was also elected a Council Member of the Ukrainian Association for Computer- Medicine. I have lectured in almost every country in Europe, and in four of the five Continents. I have delivered one or more papers at every world MEDINFO Conference since 1974, culminating in MEDINFO 2001. I R. Richards at Euromise 2013 am the only person to have presented one or more papers at every one of the first ten MEDINFO Conferences. In recognition of this unique achievement I was awarded a Plaque by the International Medical Informatics Association, (IMIA) - the organiser of MEDINFO. In 2010, I lectured at the World Pharmacology Conference in Copenhagen; the World Conference for Medical Records personnel in Milan; and on \u201cThe side effects of giving chemicals to the mother during childbirth\u201d at the International Obstetrics Conference in Romania. There I was presented, by the author, Professor Munteanu, with nd the 2 Edition of his Book \u201cTreatise in Obstetrics\u201d in which I have a Chapter. I was Chairman on the British Computer Society\u2019s Health (Northern) Specialist Group and a Committee Member of the BCS Manchester Branch Committee.  More recently, I have devoted himself to helping others. On a voluntary basis, I chair the Examination Board for the Institute of Health Records and Information Management (IHRIM), and the Examination Board for the NHS- IHRIM Examination for Clinical Coders. I have been giving lectures to the Sixth Forms in several of the High Schools in Greater Manchester, and participate regularly at the Careers Day at one such School. I have served as a Governor of a University Hall of Residence until its closure. And, in further voluntary work, have served as the Vice-Chairman of the Board of Governors in a city Primary School for over 20 years until resigning in 2016. This involved regular presence in the School, talking with the staff, teaching the children, and boosting morale. International Journal of Medical Informatics, 1998; 50: 279-285 ", "Michael Rigby": "Emeritus Professor of Health Information Strategy Keele University, UK; PhD in Health Informatics. 20 years in health services and 30 in applied academia Research, reviewing, writing; IMIA Assessment WG since 2002 50 years of Vision, Purpose, and Reality Opportunistic, exciting, purposeful! After a bachelor\u2019s degree in Geography and Economics (with emphasis on social geography and public finance) I got my first job in the Health Department of Cheshire County Council (a county serving a population of 1 million). They knew there were gaps and inequities in services, and my job was to research the needs and how best to meet them. This was true evidence-based planning long before it had been invented, thanks to a very wise County Medical Officer. Less than two years in, I was drawn into the team planning a paedatric screening scheme for all newborn children in the county. Cheshire already had a computerised immunisation scheme, based on the pioneering one in West Sussex in 1962 (pre-IMIA!). The Cheshire team was a doctor, nurse, myself, and a computer analyst\u2014we identified the planned content and pattern of service, and the excellent analyst gave us options as to what could be done, and it developed iteratively. So by 1971, we had a preventive health EHR for every pre-school child in Cheshire, scheduled immunisations and examinations, and recorded key results and diagnoses\u2014and I was put in charge of running it! Then we moved on to school health services, and by 1973 had one of the two most comprehensive community child health systems in the UK, entirely EHR-based with every resident child covered. Given that success, the final move was to a computerised cervical screening service for women. Again, this was designed to meet need, and included plans to run an algorithm suggested by Prof. George Knox for computer simulations of cervical cytology screening programmes in 1973. This was intended to offer very precise interval rescreens at 3 months and 2 years, to gain evidence on the specificity of the test and on the natural incidence of the condition. All women resident in the area were invited, and success was measured by the uptake rate, and by a more than double the average rate of finding positive results, indicating success at attracting higher-risk women. Sadly, a familiar problem arose, and a hospital-orientated organisation said it could not afford to run a quality preventive programme while treatment opportunities were underfunded, so the service was terminated. Not only was the service lost (and by implication women avoidably suffered from cancer), but my chance of using the study to gain an MSc also was lost (much later the Professor of Social Medicine supervising was told that he set the bar too high because he was afraid of Social Medicine being seen as a soft subject, and that his successful MSc student should have been submitted for a PhD, and I should have submitted the theory and initial practical successes for a Master\u2019s!). Three positive memories and learning points endure from this period. First, the excitement and rewards of pioneering new approaches successfully, bringing modern services to people universally. Second, service and population need were the drivers; the  IT service advised how to achieve this optimally. IT met need, and never imposed a solution\u2014anything else was unthinkable to all including the analyst leading the programming team. Third, opportunity is what you made of it. Of Experts, Interests, and Positions \u2013 and the Outcomes: Then, in 1974 in the UK a major reorganisation of health services saw preventive and community services relocated from local government control and integrated within new Area Health Authorities. A consequence of this change was the concept of moving to standardised and optimised services and techncial support, so rather than many local child health computer systems, an optimal national one would be developed to support every local service. Great in principle. The government commissioned the then National Computer Centre to write and produce the software, based primarily on one local system. However, they considered themselves computer experts, and health personnel as being non-expert. The system was developed, and unveiled shortly before release, with the message that there could be no changes as it was well-designed. However, the worlds of computing and healthcare were proved to have different views of daily activity \u2013 for instance, the program was based on monthly clinics being held every fourth week, whereas for healthcare they are calendar-based, such as \u2018the second Tuesday of the month\u2019. So the \u2018perfect\u2019 system had to be seriously modified, and a Standard Immunisation System Development Steering Committee set up, on which I represented my region, and which worked for two years. Thus began my work on national committees, and seeking to ensure representation whilst also ensuring action. Once corrected, the national system software was transferred to a regional NHS centre (the Welsh Common Services Authority), and a wider UK Child Health Computing Committee was set up to oversee ongoing development. This work lasted nearly twenty years, ensuring a continuous development path, and including key complementary activity such as rigorous field evaluation of new modules, and production of materials on end-user training, data protection, and in-service marketing. For fourteen years I was vice-chairman, being co-opted when I left the NHS for academia, and I led most of the working groups. Here I also learned the art of working in close tandem with a senior clinician as chair to ensure clinical confidence and credibility while organising effective action. During this time, I also documented the development of this area of health informatics. This was also a good position to observe, and at times bewail, power plays and regular policy changes. The case for single solutions (with local options and flexibility) was opposed by some who wanted to design a different approach producing the same results. Professional bodies and politicians negotiated over the respective roles of expert community services, generalist primary care practice, and public health. Harmonised standards for primary care computing were reduced in favour of commercial innovation. All these required responses and changes, not always representing good value or delivery quality. Eventually ministers decided that the NHS should not be spending resources centrally and standard computer systems should cease in favour of regional autonomy; and secondly that general practitioners should take over responsibility for preventive child health services and organise them within their practice. The Committee decided to continue its work, focusing on data and functionality standards, and on user support, but such work could only be advisory. Thus ended a specific chapter of health informatics innovation in the UK. Over a period of three decades one local initiative was taken up by other localities, developed into a much wider functionality, brought into a national standard system, developed and its use enhanced - and then closed down! There is probably much less known now about  the state of the UK\u2019s children than was known at the peak of this system\u2019s use. The successes have always been when end-users led the thinking and technical services were creatively in support; the problems were caused when IT staff, politicians, or national negotiators sought to know better for sectoral reasons. Mental Health Informatics Systems: My move into academia so I could do more research and sharing of knowledge led to many new opportunities. One was the chance to support initiatives in resource management in mental health, in a number of UK locations. Particularly significant was Plymouth in south-west England, where the initiative was to introduce electronic records linking hospital and community mental health care, and personalising care delivery. A small and committed vendor was a partner, and we facilitated clinical staff to identify optimal ways of working based on clear and accessible new-style records. This led to considerable study of EHR innovation, and regular presentations at MIE and IMIA conferences. The Royal College of Psychiatrists set up a Mental Health Information Systems Working Group, and I was an invited member. In turn this innovation cascaded to Ireland, where a significant not-for-profit independent provider of mental health services was seeking to develop a mental health EHR. In a wish to do things correctly and ethically in a sensitive but important area, this organisation ran an international working meeting, and produced a book on Ethical Use of EHR Systems, launched by the then Minister of Health. The mental health team at WHO Headquarters were interested in this work, as was the World Psychiatric Association (WPA), and Behavioral Health leaders in the USA. Working meetings were held with each of these bodies. The WPA set up an IT in Psychiatry group and I was invited to be co-chair, and WHO set up a Mental Health Informatics Standards Working Group on which I sat. However, IMIA rather wasted an opportunity. A Mental Health Informatics WG was proposed, but for unknown reasons was not immediately accepted; by the time approval was given the WHO and USA interests had moved on, and consequently less was achieved than anticipated, particularly as there was little forthcoming ethical sponsorship in this domain. Evidence and Evaluation: Given my people-focused and economic education, and my early work in assessing how best to develop services, evidence and evaluation were always strong in my mind. Anderson and Aydin\u2019s turn of the century work on evaluating healthcare information systems in the USA, and Elizabeth van Gennip and colleages in Europe, were early stimuli, with Fran\u00e7ois Gr\u00e9my providing intellectual richness. To me there was no point in investing in systems unless they were proven to work, but the opposition to such \u2018non-productive\u2019 use of resources was strong. One UK senior national policy-maker claimed it was just academics trying to create work for themselves; three years later, when one of the national flagship ideas did not take off, the policy team admitted that impartial evidence from evaluation was the crucial missing factor and that I had been right to call for a monitored pilot, but by then it was too late. Wanting to draw attention to this problem, I sought to sum up the issues in a paper to MEDINFO 2001. Elske Ammenwerth then picked up the momentum, supported by Jan Talmon and others, not least with a major funded workshop in Innsbruck in 2003 There has been subsequent robust ongoing work, largely jointly by the IMIA Working Group on Technology Assessment and Quality Development and the EFMI Assessment of Health Information Systems Working Group, in which I have been active. Much of this expertise has been brought together in a key comprehensive publication. The production of evidence, and an evidence-based approach for new investment in health informatics, has to be the way forward.  A European Focus: Increasingly I have extended learning and sharing across Europe and wider; this has been increasingly enriching and rewarding. I have held academic posts in the UK, Ireland and Sweden, and worked collaboratively over all the EU and EEA countries and many others besides. Mutual collaboration and recognition are key to the way forward, but with acknowledgement and respect for local differences. I now live in Ireland and hold two citizenships but feel European with an Irish home rather than confined by nationality. An IMIA Footnote: I have presented peer-reviewed papers at eight MEDINFO congresses\u2014all those from 1989 to 2010 inclusive. Following retirement, obtaining funding has been the main barrier. A rigorous drive to promote ethical and evidence- based approaches to the production of health informatics interventions should be an increasingly key part of IMIA\u2019s mission, linking with WHO, academic, health professional, and consumer interests; working with industry but not being afraid to challenge. Given the pivotal role of informatics in modern health care, more resources need to be found so that IMIA and its expert groups can be more proactive and influential in setting ideas and standards. ", "Jean Roberts": "Director of Education, Training & Professional Development (Standards) Senior Lecturer / Consultant University of Central Lancashire / Phoenix Associates I chose a Computer Science degree course in part because my grades did not signal a \u2018pure science course\u2019 and at that time computing was a \u2018new\u2019 topic. On my 4-year course there were a mix of genders and of those with arts or science backgrounds. It interestingly transpired that the arts and language students found the computer coding and languages much easier to grasp than us with science qualifications. My vocational year 3 at college was spent on a placement with a local authority writing an immunisation application for children under 5. Health was at that time (1970) a spilt responsibility; which in fact plays back full circle to the UK proposals for health and social care convergence nowadays. After a brief spell in business computing, family commitments moved me from my home county (Yorkshire) to Lancashire, historically geographic adversaries but by then only really competitive in sporting activities. At the University of Lancaster, I became Computer Services support to external clients, one of which was the local NHS hospital. Through the vision of its senior staff and because they had no computing power of their own, we analysed their accident and emergency (trauma) patient records for trends. This was done by overnight use of statistics packages from US universities. Uncovering practical issues\u2014areas where additional support might be required for answering population health questions, or where support for different staff groups might improve patient care and work-life balance were main drivers for me. The statistical analysis work was followed by practical projects for local clinicians including intravenous feeding calculations, cross-infection monitoring on the wards, and electromyographic signal processing as well as a major translation (and extension) of a London hospital pathology system to function for a \u2018general\u2019 hospital which had a very extensive range of clients including blood work for the local power station workers! Along with my day job, I taught computer awareness to local council staff, a very early indication of what would later become the academic aspects of my life. The larger Regional Health Authority (RHA) wanted to redeploy me in its other District Health Authorities but that was countered by Lancaster Health Authority confirming my post as the first NHS District Computer Services Officer in the country (around 1980). Much later I did move to the RHA leading a team putting Patient Administration Systems and Manpower Planning tools into the other 18 Districts, working closely with vendors as the requirements of each organisation were necessarily slightly different due to local priorities, functions and developing technologies. It was logical (to me) to gravitate to the vendor sphere, for both developing new applications and evaluating whether existing solutions could be re-versioned for health (including holiday booking schemes)\u2014and working on outsourcing and facilities management of rd health requirements by 3 party computer centres to facilitate capitalisation on new technologies and the larger capacity presented by commercial providers at that time.  I went next into \u2018consulting\u2019. I covered risk analysis, value for money assessments, and developing study materials and teaching through the well-received \u2018RAINBOW\u2019 series on health informatics topics and the EU-funded IT-EDUCTRA project. Going solo as \u2018Phoenix Associates\u2019 in 1999 I continued consulting on learning themes and health management topics, transitioning into formal academia at the University of Central Lancashire (2004-2010) where I taught within the 2-year Foundation degrees right through to supervising Masters\u2019 on health informatics topics, mainly for students who were doing the courses while also holding down operational jobs within the NHS and social care organisations. Alongside this I carried out external advising, assessment and examination for various other universities across the UK and Ireland. Getting involved at post-grad levels prompted me to make contact with my Alma Mater, the University of Teesside and do a PhD myself on \u2018The contribution made to the support of healthcare delivery and management by health informatics at a local and national level over a period of 30 years\u2019. This was developed by analysis of my previous publications throughout those years and awarded \u2018by completed work\u2019 at the end of 2005. Since 1974, and with the encouragement of my then clinical bosses I have been involved in professionalization of health informatics from the establishment of the HC health computing congress and exhibition in the UK (from which UK eHealth Week has evolved), writing for many journals (grey literature and formal scientific), and the first European Federation of Medical Informatics MIE congress in Cambridge (1978). For IMIA, I first participated (1977) and presented at MEDINFO in Tokyo (1980) on our intravenous feeding support work and casualty activity analysis, becoming UK national IMIA representative and subsequently a Board Member for many years. In that time, I had the honour of chairing the Local Organising Committee of MEDINFO 2001 in London and chairing an Emerging Countries development group. I am very indebted to IMIA colleagues for the knowledge I gained to help with my writing, teaching, academic research, and putting consultancy work into context. I owe a great debt to the interesting people I met and places I saw during those times. It was sometimes challenging to convince funders of the value of international events and projects, but I can definitely list so many initiatives that have been enhanced by such interactions with peer groups, insights from other countries and very worthwhile knowledge exchange through multi- national work. In 2002, the UK established the UK Council for Health Informatics Professions (UKCHIP) as an initiative to recognise professionalism through voluntary regulation and registration. My involvement latterly has been in standards of competence both nationally and in the EU:US HIT Comp initiative. Now the domain scope has widened in the UK to encompass other professional groups such as the Chartered Institute of Library Professionals, Institute of Health Records and Information Management, Society for IT Professionals in the Public Sector (SocITM) and BCS Health, under the Federation of IP so standards are being reviewed once more. I said in the beginning \u2018it is difficult to recognise a health informatician in a bus queue\u2019. With the current momentum globally, it will hopefully become easier, and their identity will become clearer and recognition will be improved. I believe in the embedding of health informatics competences in ALL health and social care professional curriculums and operational standards. \u2018Data\u2019 needs context to support effective manipulation, interpretation and to become operationally useful \u2018information\u2019. The demand for such information resources now comes from the wider health community including professionals and citizens. Digital enablement is improving in all sectors, and the digital divide is fading fast. However, facilitating  necessary competences through training and recognition must be in place to realise value, and the logistics (and politics) of its integrated delivery is challenging. What I learnt most throughout my checkerboard of career opportunities is that \u2018health informatics\u2019 is not the preserve of the few but a tool for everyone. Concepts like robotics, gaming, ambient monitoring and shared records have still to come of age; but will be utilised by professionals and citizens alike over time. I get great satisfaction from having played a very small part in these developments. I value my accolades over time, notably the eHealth Leadership Award from HIMSS Europe (2011) and my election to the IMIA International Academy of Health Sciences Informatics (2017) but probably get the greatest satisfaction from reflecting on the myriad of operational changes that could not have happened without health informatics over the last 46 years. ", "Batami Sadan": "Chair of ILAMI, The Israel Association for Medical Informatics How it all started. I got married in 1966, in Israel, and my husband got accepted into a PhD program in Business Administration in California two years later. Although he received a scholarship, even in those days it was going to be insufficient to live on comfortably, so, before going there, I took a year to study systems analysis and programing, thinking that it would be an international skill and language that would open doors for me anywhere in the world. I was absolutely right! B. Sadan, PhD I don\u2019t want to elaborate on the culture-shock that awaited us two puritanical Israelis, living in California during the years 1968-1972! However, those were also the days when Medical Informatics was forming, and I was very lucky to be accepted to work at Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, California. This proved to be a turning point in my professional life (although I was only in my early twenties) and it paved the way for my future studies and work. Conference in Medical Information Systems Chaired by Morris F. Collen held in January 1970 in San Francisco. The purposes of the conference were to define the current state of technology; to identify the problems; needs and emerging technology; and to consider alternative computer applications of multiple-facility medical information systems for the delivery of medical care and for health services research. Not much different from conference themes these days\u2026. What catches my attention when reading the proceedings today is Collen's vision: \u201cA prime concept of MIS is that it is needed to serve as the central register and medical data repository for all patients eligible for care in the health services delivery system. The most essential requirement for MIS is an integrated computer record of all data from each hospitalization and out-patient visit of each patient. Small collections of patient data for subsystem components (such as blood banks, laboratories etc.) will never satisfy services requirements.\u201d \u2026 \u201cEach datum should be stored once in its most fundamental unit of information.\u201d \u2026 \u201cit is necessary to be able to retrieve on demand all or any specified portion of the individual patient's record (1) in chronological order by patient visits, or (2) by medical services\u201d. My Personal Contribution. Kaiser Permanente had come up with a ground breaking public health solution devised by Collen - the multi phasic screening which took healthy patients and administered a battery of laboratory and other screening tests that helped separate the mix of patients entering the system into the well, the asymptomatic sick and the sick. This separation or \u201ctriage\u201d made it possible to match physician service to patient needs and devote them most to where they were mostly needed: the care of the sick. The Asymptomatic sick with one abnormality like high blood pressure or diabetes were referred to special outpatient clinics at the Health Center, run by specially trained nurses. The nurses were given written protocols on how to manage the chronic condition they were assigned to.  I worked for one of those clinics in the Health Center\u2014the Specialty Kidney Clinic and took it a step further. I programed the protocol as an AI system, giving Advice Rules to the nurse for each patient visit guiding them towards actions they were supposed to take according to the stage of a patient\u2019s disease and the lab results. It was very innovative as software, developed at about the same time as MYCIN was being developed. Unfortunately, my software was not developed further because we left California and despite its popularity, it was discontinued by Kaiser Permanente by the late 1970s when funding from a federal grant supporting the work was discontinued, and Kaiser Permanente did not commit its own resources to it. However, it proved to be most useful during the period it was operational and gave me a life-long insight into the value of medical informatics systems that can help support and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical care.

After I established the Computer Centre we needed statistical software because at that time there were no statistical software packages in Turkey. We decided to develop some software ourselves for data processing. The software included some basic statistical analyses and parametric crosstabulations solutions. I received a master\u2019s degree in 1976. and a Ph.D. in 1982 in Biostatistics at Hacettepe University, Faculty of Health Science. My Master\u2019s thesis was on \u201cThe Reliability of Health Record\u201d and my PhD. thesis was entitled \u201cChoosing the Most Appropriate Model in Nonlinear Regression on Health Data\u201d. Between 1974-1982, I worked as an instructor on the Medical Faculty, the Department of Public Health and between 1982-1988 in the Department of Biostatistics, Hacettepe University, Ankara. In 1985 I spent 6 months as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Kent in Canterbury, UK. According to the rules of Higher Education in Turkey, I had to go to another university for an academic career upgrade. Therefore, in 1988 I started to work at Akdeniz University in Antalya. I established the Information Processing and Computer Center in 1989 and managed it until 1996. During at this period, we established the first in-house Hospital Information System in Turkey. At the same time, I also established the Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, and then gave Biostatistics and Computer Use courses to the Medical Faculty staff at Akdeniz University at first. I became an Assistant Professor in 1988 and an Associate Professor in 1989. When we were developing our Hospital Information System, we needed some information about medical informatics. Where could we find this information? I also spent great efforts to develop a medical informatics curriculum for undergraduate medical education and nursing education. In those years, there was no Internet, but there was Europe Academic Research Network (EARN). Using EARN I accessed Medical Informatics topics from Stanford University. Then I decided to start the first Medical Informatics Master\u2019s program in 1992. When we had enough staff in 2004, a PhD program was started. The second Medical Informatics Master\u2019s and Ph.D. programs began in 2003 at the Middle East Technical University (METU) in Ankara in collaboration with Akdeniz University. I gave same courses between 2003-2010 as a visiting professor.  I became a Full Professor in 1996 and worked as the Chief of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics Department in the Faculty of Medicine at Akdeniz University until I retired in 2013. In 2015 I started to work at the Near East University Faculty of Health Sciences in North Cyprus as a part-time professor. My efforts for the Turkish Medical Informatics Association (TurkMIA): After the foundation of Turkish Medical Informatics Association (TurkMIA) in 1999, the Association became a member of IMIA and EFMI. TurkMIA assumed the leading role for developments in the field of health informatics while increasing awareness of the need for health informatics professions has led to the development of graduate health informatics education programs. I was president of TurkMIA from 2005 until 2010. Currently I work as a Board Member of TurkMIA and as representative of Turkey to the European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI). On behalf of TurkMIA, I had a leading role in organizing numerous national and international congresses and activities. I worked as a Local Organizing Committee Chair and Scientific Commute Member for EFMI STC 2009 (Travel Health Informatics \u2013 Mobility in Europe) held in Antalya. The place is a very well-chosen and famous as a wonderful tourist destination. Another important meeting I helped organize was MIE2014. I worked as the Local Organizing Committee Chair and Scientific Committee Member for this 25th European Medical Informatics Conference (MIE2014), organized by the European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) and the Turkish Medical Informatics Association (TurkMIA), held between August 31st\u2013September 3rd, 2014 in Istanbul. In total, 536 participants from over 45 countries attended MIE 2014 in Istanbul. It was the first time that Turkey had hosted MIE, which took place in one of the most beautiful congress centers: the Hali\u00e7 Congress Center. MIE 2014 was a great opportunity for the participants gathering in Istanbul to participate in sessions and discussions on best strategies and skills for managing the projects and initiatives in medical informatics. I believe the knowledge received from the conference and memories of Istanbul were very beneficial and unforgettable for the attendees. My research interests focus on Evaluation Methods in Medical Informatics, Electronic Health Records, Research Methods in Health Sciences, Health Information Standards, and Decision Making in Medicine, Multivariate Statistical Methods and Biostatistics. I have several publications including books as a writer and editor in the field of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics and I have given several graduate courses at different universities in Turkey and North Cyprus. At the moment I am still involved as chairman of the Scientific Program Committee of the national conferences that are organized annualy by TurkMIA. In 2017 the topics was the \u201cInternet of Things in Health\u201d. ", "Roger Salamon": "Emeritus Professor of Public Health, University of Bordeaux The first Master of Informatics opened in Paris (Paris- Jussieu) in 1967. At that time, I was a young student in the School of Mathematics and I became immediately interested in this new specialty, and decided to follow this new curriculum. At the same time, I was a medical student in the same University in which the Professor Fran\u00e7ois Gr\u00e9my was teaching. Very quickly I was integrated in his team and I became one of his closest assistants. Together with some few others we developed a curriculum of Medical Informatics in France. Some years later, Fran\u00e7ois Gr\u00e9my founded IMIA from the IFIP-TC4 group and asked me to become the General Secretary of IMIA which I did during a few years (in the 1980\u2019s), working with some of the leaders of the specialty. I remember some of them - sorry if I forget others - Kaihara, Reichertz, van Bemmel, Mandil, Peterson, Willems, Ball, Lindberg\u2026 All of them were pioneers and outstanding scientists. My work in Paris was almost exclusively dedicated to the topic of Medical Decision Making. Following the work of Tim De Dombal (Leeds UK) I developed a large Bayesian System for Neurological diagnosis. This was the topic of my PhD thesis and my main publication at that time was in \u00ab Methods of Information in Medicine \u00bb. I became Professor in Bordeaux and little by little I left the field of Medical Decision Making and I oriented my work to the field of Health Informatics. In Bordeaux I have built a School of Public Health with a large part of Informatics covering several topics: \u2022 Hospital information systems \u2022 Management of large cohorts \u2022 Support for epidemiological studies \u2022 Biostatistics My principal research works were in the field of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and of HIV in developing countries (especially West Africa). I have established several degrees in public health and health informatics and, most especially, an e-learning program in Public Health which is the largest among French speaking e-learning programs that has enrolled more than 5000 students in more than 60 countries during the past ten years. I am retiring, but delighted that a lot of young specialists are going to continue the work initiated a long time ago by my mentor Fran\u00e7ois Gr\u00e9my and which I have tried with others French colleagues to further develop. ", "Kaija Saranto": "Professor, Health and Human Services Informatics, University of Turku IMIA SIGNI Vice Chair and MEDINFO Vice President This reflection presents the highlights of my experiences in the health and nursing informatics (NI) area, with a focus on my activities in education, research, and development over the years. After finishing my computer science studies in the late 1980s, I was privileged to compile a basic course in information technology for student nurses. Despite having a brand-new IT classroom with 18 PCs, I felt almost desperate at not having any software or tools with which I K. Saranto, PhD, RN, could apply IT for health care, so as to prove to young FACMI, FAAN students that data processing was the future and would be commonplace someday in daily practice. My teaching knowledge and outcomes improved remarkably when I joined the health and Nursing Informatics (NI) community in 1994, and participated in my first NI conference in San Antonio, Texas. Since then, I have been lucky to be regularly involved in every NI conference as a presenter, reviewer, chairperson, or a member of the committees. Surprisingly, it was also in San Antonio at the American Medical Informatics (AMIA) conference in 2002 where I developed the idea of bringing the NI conference to Finland. Among international conferences, NI 2009 was thus a very special event for me because it was organized in Helsinki, Finland, and I was honored to chair the scientific program committee. Along with my colleagues, Dr. Marianne Tallberg and Dr. Anneli Ensio, we worked together as a team with international committee members, Dr. Patricia Brennan, Dr. Hyeoun-Ae Park, and Dr. Walter Sermeus. Organizing conferences involves challenges and risks. In our case, we were able to manage our risks well with the support of the Finnish Nurses Association. However, we considered the weather to be our greatest challenge. Although the conference was held in June, we were not expecting nice and warm weather because Finland is a Nordic country. All our fears disappeared when the sun shone for 24 hours, and the temperature was nearly 30\u00b0C during the entire conference. All in all, the conference was successful, with nearly 500 participants representing more than 35 countries. My involvement with International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) activities started in the late 1990s when I served first as a member of the board and then as the president of the Finnish Social and Health Informatics Association from 2007 to 2009. The innovative and creative ideas of our previous president, Dr. Mikko Korpela, led us, first, to found an annual national health and social informatics research symposium in 1998 and, later, to establish a joint scientific journal, the Finnish Journal of eHealth and eWelfare, together with the Finnish Society of Telemedicine and eHealth in 2010. Both the symposia and the journal have been excellent forums for young and advanced researchers to share their experiences, and results of implementations, modeling, usability, and testing of various systems and tools, not to mention education and management. I have participated in various roles in each of the symposia and have been a member of the first editorial board of the journal. I feel privileged to have been  able to follow closely the scientific advances in the field of health informatics (HI) in Finland. Dr. Korpela was also my active co-editor; we realized that we would definitively need a study book for students in health informatics. Basing ourselves on experience with the health and social care service system in Finland, we were convinced that the book should focus both on health and social care informatics. In the late 1990s, social care informatics was almost totally missing in curricula, but electronic information systems were already being used in social care. Thus, despite suggestions that we should concentrate only on HI, we decided to focus both on health and social care informatics. Although containing various perspectives, our Finnish study book proved to be ahead of its time. In 1999, when the book was published, educators in the health, medical, and social fields seem to have had difficulties in using and implementing the knowledge that our book provided. Nearly two decades after its publication, our book still has some content areas that are relevant in such fields. All in all, the slow progress in our field is evident. With my nurse educator IT background, I found it very rewarding to establish the first Master\u2019s degree curricula for HHSI in 2000 at the University of Eastern Finland (previously the University of Kuopio). The first intake was truly a success because over 400 candidates sent their applications and were willing to complete their Master\u2019s degree in HHSI. In the early years, the annual intake varied, stabilizing to 16 students, which proved successful both in terms of the number of graduates and the resources available. The aim was to educate professionals and researchers in information management for the needs of health and social care service systems. The curricula follow the IMIA Recommendations on Education in Health and Medical Informatics. In 2012, the curricula passed the accreditation program launched by IMIA as the very first Master\u2019s degree program among IMIA academic member societies. l would like to express my gratitude to Dr. Arie Hasman and Dr. John Mantas for guiding our program development further. As the professor responsible for the program, I am truly proud of my excellent students who led outstanding careers and left tracks in the development of this field. I have also been fortunate to share our Finnish experiences in HI education with our African colleagues in the 2010s. The Institutional Collaboration Instrument for Informatics Development for Health in Africa project focused especially on developing the capacities of three African higher education institutes in HI and eHealth education. Seminars and symposia with students and educators from Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa, and Finland served as an eye opener to me at first, but later on, I realized that we had the same learning needs for students and the same project objectives despite differences in facilities and locations. The cooperation also taught me to improvise and relax, but, most importantly, I realized that water and electricity are truly important resources. The enthusiasm of multidisciplinary students was inspiring; following their development over the years was also rewarding because some students first obtained a Master\u2019s degree, followed by a PhD degree, for instance, at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, IT Department, which is led by Dr. Retha Harper. Aside from European and African cooperation, I have participated frequently over the years in AMIA conferences and shared our Finnish and European experiences in eHealth activities with colleagues. Having a public health care service system in Finland, I found it challenging sometimes to convince the international audience how simple some decisions can be. The one I have been especially impressed with is the unique identity code we have had for decades in Finland. Although our solutions for data protection and privacy have been met with criticism, the personal code provides advantages for system  designs. Another example is related to terminology development. Most standards and terminologies are originally written in English, so convincing international experts about the importance of validation when translating documents has been challenging. Furthermore, translation terminologies and classification should be mapped to be most effective and have the best impact within information systems. When I first met Dr. Virginia Saba in the 1990s, I learned from her the importance of codes, and since then, I have tried to follow her advice. Research cooperation with international colleagues is rewarding because it provides not only comparative data but also possibilities to benchmark processes more widely. Quality and patient safety research involves many interesting phenomena. The most recent study we are working on focuses on the use of smart pumps in intravenous medication. Although Finland, which has roughly six million inhabitants, represents a small population in health service and patient safety research, observing how many similarities can be found in human behavior, for instance, in hospitals in the US and Finland, has been interesting. I am especially grateful to Dr. David Bates and Dr. Patricia Dykes who have guided us in patient safety research. As we all know, information flow is a key factor that affects patient safety. The decade of 2000 was an active period of HIT development in Finland. In 2002, the national health informatics program started, and I was involved in several working groups that targeted a national structured electronic health record (EHR). A special expert group defined the core data elements for the EHR. These definitions led to national solutions, which served as the basic elements for the present data archives. Kanta services, which include an ePrescription center, a pharmaceutical database, and a patient data repository for both private and public service providers, was warmly accepted by citizens. From our studies, some difficulties were encountered in the implementation of ePrescriptions during the beginning of the nation-wide deployment of the process in 2011. However, the system is now fully operating nationally, both in primary and specialized health care. In addition to the acceptance of the ePrescription center, the positive effects of the use of data archives are evident to both citizens and professionals, who have benefited from the use of such data. As a citizen, I hope that the national service architecture will improve security in data sharing and the safety of information flow among service providers to ensure high-quality services. As a researcher, I hope that the architecture will open new avenues for big data research. In 2014 I co-edited the Nursing Informatics Conference Proceedings (cover illustrated below), and in 2017 led the arrangements as IMIA Vice-President for the MEDINFO congress we held in the beautiful city of Hangzhou, and was delighted to meet so many of you there! ", "Maureen Scholes": "Chair & Organiser, First International Conference on Nursing Informatics, London, 1983; Founding Member, BCS Nursing Specialist Group; Former Director of Nursing Services (Matron), The London Hospital; Founder & Chair, IMIA WG8 Nursing (later SIG- NI); Former Acting Chief Executive, The London Hospital Nursing Experience: I started nursing at the Croft Home in Reigate before I was accepted for the three- year training at The (now Royal) London Hospital in 1947. I had over 5 years as a ward sister in charge of a busy general surgery and neurosurgery ward and had taken a course at the (subsequently Royal) College of Nursing on Senior management. I had been closely involved in the management of change in two particular projects concerning the measurement of errors in drug administration and the design of a system to reduce those errors and the re-design of the patients\u2019 medical records to facilitate the location of key information needed in the clinical management of care. Management of Change: Not only had the nurses been involved from the start with the computing at The London Hospital but I had explored the possibility of using the hospital\u2019s Elliott 803 computer to help with the nurse allocations problems that I was then dealing with. At that time, it was thought that this problem would need more computing power, but the issue surfaced again later when Alex Barr from the Oxford Regional Hospital Board had offered us a program for nurse allocation using the Elliott 803. However, further investigation suggested that the first steps should be based on a significant system of data collection of the training records of nurses rather than the complicated mathematics of the allocation process. At that time, it was decided that the next step should be the implementation of a jacketed microfiche system for holding the nurses\u2019 training records rather than a computer system. This two-year project resulted in eighteen 4-drawer filing cabinets being reduced into a single cabinet and the records were carefully thinned by the senior staff in matron\u2019s office to focus on the information needed for future reference. This system lasted for many years until suitable computerised systems could be developed. About this time and at the request of the Director of Operational Research, I wrote an internal paper on \u201cProblems in the General Wards and Possible Computer Help\u201d which outlined a work programme for decades to come. These thoughts were updated in the light of the work undertaken as the hospital computer systems began to take shape in papers in the Nursing Mirror in 1976 and 1979. Further work was undertaken later to assess the study programme of student nurses and to computerise the nursing records of learners and staff. Joining the Computer Executive: Initially, I was asked by the Matron, Dame Phyllis Friend, to attend a group \u201cto talk about computers\u201d. I little realised that it was going to be a lifetime\u2019s involvement and I was still participating when I retired. When the hospital began to explore the design of a new computer system on the basis of the real time interaction between the professional staff it was clear that some form of multi- disciplinary group would be needed to oversee this development and take the major  decisions about what systems should be computerised, how this should be done and in what order it should be done. Accordingly, a Computer Executive was established to take charge of the project. In addition to myself, this Executive included the Professor of Medicine, Robert Cohen, the Deputy House Governor, Michael Fairey, together with Directors of Computing and Operational Research, Bud Abbott and Barry Barber. In total at the start of the project the five of us had had 100 years of experience at the hospital between us. This Computer Executive controlled the development of The London Hospital\u2019s Real Time Computer System. It was charged with developing a detailed Feasibility Study for the proposed system based on previous work on a batch processing system outlined after three years\u2019 experience using the hospital\u2019s Elliott 803 computer. After this Feasibility Study had been accepted, we developed the Invitation to Tender on which the computer system was purchased and developed. Throughout my involvement with computers, I was still working full time as a nurse administrator. Like the doctor and the administrator on the Computer Executive, I continued with my normal work in the hospital. This contrasted markedly with arrangements made in other places where they tended to recruit quite junior nurses into their project teams. This approach gave the computer teams access to clinical terms, information and concepts as well as giving the nurses ground level insight into the practical approaches to computer systems development. However, inevitably the advice and guidance of junior nurses could not compare with that of a senior nurse who was closely involved with and jointly responsible for the key policy decisions taken about the project which she would have to help implement personally with her colleagues. Bud Abbott and Barry Barber, also, continued with their computing and operational research work but they were much more closely involved with the technical details of the computer system\u2019s development and evaluation. I slowly became acquainted with the technical computing language and frequently had to make my colleagues spell out more clearly what they were proposing and to insist that they approach the non-computer problems as professionally as they addressed the computer problems. The issues of training and the management of change in a large organisation needed to be addressed properly if the project was to succeed. Also, the selection of areas suitable for computerisation was important, as was the order in which the systems were tackled. Staff Training: I believed that it was important that the senior staff should not be put in the position of having their juniors tell them about the new computer system proposals before they had had the information themselves. Accordingly, we arranged a series of 1-day training sessions at the top of the Alexandra School of Nursing. The various members of the Executive talked through the technical proposals and I talked through training and confidentiality issues \u2013 the professor of medicine decided to do the slot on \u201chardware\u201d! The afternoon was spent in exploring the specific issues surrounding the systems that were to be implemented and how the various members of staff would be able to handle the systems \u2013 exploring difficulties, finding possible solutions and agreeing on the best way forward. These sessions started with the medical consultants, senior nurses and heads of departments and then progressed to more junior staff as the various systems were to be implemented in their areas of activity. This approach was implemented from the \u201ctop down\u201d as well as from the \u201cbottom up\u201d but with agreements that were made and stuck to from both sides. The training actually managed to include all the consultant staff except one who proved totally resistant and it was linked to the stage of development of the computer system and the areas of activity about to be implemented. I presented a paper on these issues at MEDINFO-74.  Confidentiality: From the very beginning of the use of computers in the medical area there had been concerns about the issues of privacy, accuracy and reliability of computer held patient data. These worries surfaced internationally most noticeably in Sweden, while the rest of us were still trying to make things work. It had, of course, been an issue in the development of The London Hospital Real Time System as doctors needed to be sure that they and their professional bodies were satisfied that the patient information that they entrusted to the computer system was kept confidential, was available when needed and had not been altered. These issues became easier as more colleagues had used the hospital\u2019s Elliott 803 computer and other university computers for their research work. The discussions began to revolve around the practical matters such as what levels of security were appropriate and how extensive were the system back- ups to be. A lot of effort had been devoted to getting a fast message switching computer with fast access drums so that the system\u2019s menu selection processes could be made fast and easy to use. However, it was realised that too much security could make the systems impossible to use in the context of a busy hospital. In a real-time system, it is important that the transactions can be completed within the timescale of the patient- staff interaction. If the system is not fast enough to do this, the information is written down for input later and all the benefits of the real time approach are lost. This is a \u201cmake or break\u201d issue in system design. The finally agreed test was that the new computer systems should not be less confidential and secure than the existing manual systems, but the project was designed to increase the usability of patient data rather than to increase its security. The initial focus on the administrative patient data as opposed to the full medical record was consistent with that approach. IMIA Working Group 4: IMIA WG4 one of the first working groups to be set up under IFIP/TC4 initially and chaired by Prof Gerd Griesser. The group organised two working conferences outlining the approaches to these issues. David Kenny and I joined the group to help our thinking about these issues for the London Hospital project. Discussions in the working group led to two valuable publications. In due course David Kenny took over the chair and the group continued to assist with and benefit from discussions about the computer developments as they unfolded at The London Hospital. These issues of confidentiality, integrity and availability have been at the heart of all discussions where patient information is being collected and held on computer systems. Without adequate assurance on these issues no system would be viable or acceptable to the doctors and nurses professional bodies. IMIA WG4 provided a key international forum in which these issues could be explored and solutions found and the monographs provided good advice for those both using and building health information systems. Developing Nursing Informatics: Discussions within the British Computer Society led to the development of a Nursing Specialist Group to complement the existing Medical Specialist Groups as a forum for discussion of nursing issues that were being tackled at the hospital. Natural links with the other groups led to participation in the first MEDINFO conference in Stockholm. For quite some time our medical colleagues believed that medical informatics was nothing to do with nurses despite the critical roles that they played in patient care. We had slowly begun to have individual papers in conference programmes, and we then had Nursing Informatics sessions in MEDCOMP- 77 & MIE- 79 and it became crystal clear during the Tokyo MEDINFO-80 session that the interest in nursing informatics was much greater than had been expected. Shigekoto Kaihara arranged for us to have a much larger room than had been provided initially and he arranged for us to have the services of the best Japanese interpreter from the United Nations. Her almost instantaneous interpretation ensured that there was a very easy  discussion and understanding between the Japanese nurses and the English-speaking nurses. It was quite a revelation. The Next Steps: Bud Abbott, Barry Barber and I came back from Tokyo with the idea of persuading the IMIA General Assembly that a working conference on Nursing Informatics was timely and desirable and that the BCS could host the conference following the successful EFMI (MIE-78) Conference in Cambridge. By this time our contacts within IMIA, EFMI and the NHS enabled us to put together a substantial international conference in London entitled \u201cThe Impact of Computers on Nursing\u201d, which provided the basic funding followed by a smaller working conference at the NHS Training Centre in Harrogate. The proceedings of the conference laid the foundations for the future foundation of IMIA WG8 at MEDINFO-83 in Amsterdam which also had an associated full day of papers on nursing informatics. IMIA WG8 and SIG-NI: After the London conference it was quite clear to all that nurses had an important part to play in the development of informatics in healthcare and the IMIA General Assembly, at MEDINFO-83, agreed to the development of Working Group 8 on Nursing Informatics. At last, we became masters of our own destiny! I was elected as the first chairman. I nominated Katharine Hannah as the Vice Chairman and Elly Pliyter-Wenting as the Secretary. We established our terms of reference, surveyed the activities being undertaken in the various 10 countries that were represented and decided, amongst other things, to hold the second international conference in Calgary, Canada, in 1985. The next meeting was a Special Educational Task Force in Stockholm in 1987 and this was followed by the third international conference in Dublin in 1988 and a fourth international conference in Melbourne Australia in 1991. Once there was an international platform for nurses to explore issues associated with the use of computers in medicine/healthcare there was no looking back. Nursing Informatics was clearly a major discipline and here to stay\u2014SIG-NI was on its way. We set up rotating arrangements for the officers. The next chairmen were Katharine Hannah, Elly Pluyter-Wenting, Ulla Gerdin and Evelyn Hovenga. The development of these activities is outlined in a booklet by Maureen Scholes, Marriane Tallberg and Elly Pluyter-Wenting. The administrative records of our meetings have sometimes got lost but our published papers are there for all to see. ", "Philip Scott": "Reader in Health Informatics, University of Portsmouth Digital Healthcare Architect, Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust An Unexpected Journey When I left school at the age of 16, I had no idea that I would one day end up in healthcare or academia. No one in my family had ever gone to university. My first job was early morning cleaning. I did not return to education for about fifteen years. In the mid-1980s, I got an admin job in the circulation Dr. P. Scott, MSc, PhD, department of the local newspaper. I learned to touch-type CITP, FBCS, FHEA using a heavy old manual typewriter. My department had to use a green-screen terminal-based system (not unlike extant PAS products!) to manage newspaper distribution and calculate sales numbers. I had my first brush with computer programming as a personal interest in the days of cassette tapes to record BASIC code from a Sinclair ZX Spectrum, with a portable black-and-white TV as the monitor. When PCs were introduced at the newspaper, I suggested that the company send me to a programming course so that I could create something more \u201cmodern\u201d. I used the dBase III language to build a new system, which lasted for quite a few years. The problem was capacity\u2014our early PCs typically only had 200 MB hard drives, so the database had to be structured in sections that were restored from tape when needed, then backed up to tape when finished. Even with \u201chigh-speed\u201d tape streamers, it often took 30 minutes to load the required data, and not infrequently the database was corrupted. I joined the National Health Service (NHS) as an information analyst in 1994, on a three-month contract to provide cover for an analyst on maternity leave. The workload was primarily to take a data extract from PAS and run it through various spreadsheet calculations to produce monthly management reports. I quickly realized that most of this could be automated, so I wrote some programs that reduced the report generation time from about three weeks to one hour. When the person I had been covering for came back to work, my programs were soon deleted and the slow manual process re-asserted itself! The \u201cYear 2000\u201d challenge then came along. My NHS employer used an old software product to record \u201ccommunity contacts\u201d\u2014things like the numbers of health visitors or district nurse visits\u2014that had to be reported for contract monitoring purposes. I was employed as a programmer, with the task of making the old product \u201cY2K- compliant\u201d. That turned out to be quite simple and only involved changing a few 2-digit year fields to 4-digit fields. Rather embarrassingly, some of my own software later turned out not only to be \u201cY2K\u201d non-compliant, but \u201c1998-non-compliant\u201d, as I had forgotten some hard-coded date strings left in the source code from the testing phase. That was the high era of the \u201cNHS internal market\u201d\u2014the political fiction that some parts of the NHS were \u201cpurchasers\u201d and that others were \u201cproviders\u201d. The \u201cproviders\u201d, then as now, were mostly acute hospitals who just carried on spending money with little regard for what \u201cpurchasers\u201d wanted. In my view, all this \u201cmarket\u201d achieved was the creation of a vast industry of counting and re-counting NHS activity data so that \u201cpurchasers\u201d could convince themselves they were somehow in control. We had what  was called a \u201cbi-lateral data quality group\u201d between our \u201cprovider\u201d organization and the local health authority \u201cpurchaser\u201d. In essence, it boiled down to arguing about how many things had happened, how many of them should have happened, and how many of them would be paid for. A colleague and I used to call it the \u201cHow many did you make it?\u201d meeting. A golden age for bureaucrats. After stints as a project manager and IT Manager, eventually I became Head of IT Projects & Development for a regional \u201cshared service\u201d covering all the NHS services in our local geographical patch. In the early 2000s, we had to persuade general practitioners to connect their practice networks to the new \u201cNHSnet\u201d. During that period, because each organization had its own email system, I developed software to query each email server in our area and build a consolidated directory that everyone could access. That worked fine until we found that the service provider for NHSnet would randomly re-boot the firewalls at each general practice, thereby losing the special rules that we had put in to allow the email server to be queried. I did not hear of \u201chealth informatics\u201d until I had been in the NHS for several years. I had a very enlightened boss who encouraged me to do a part-time MSc, which I did from 2001-2003. I was allowed to register based on my professional experience. As so much of what we were doing in the local NHS was about interoperability, I started attending meetings of HL7 UK. I was elected to the Board of HL7 UK in 2005 and remain a member, having been Chair from 2011-17. I also continued my academic development, with a part-time PhD exploring how clinicians react to new information systems. In 2009, I left the NHS and became a Senior Lecturer at the University of Portsmouth. My research interests are health IT evaluation, interoperability, usability, continuity of care, and health IT for developing countries. I began to see the value of participating in BCS for UK activities and EFMI and IMIA working groups and conferences for international collaboration. In 2014, I was invited to join the IMIA Technology Assessment and Quality Development working group (which functions also as the EFMI Evaluation working group). That has led to numerous joint publications, including most recently the first edition of our book on applied theory in health informatics. Within BCS, I was appointed an associate editor of our house journal (then called Informatics in Primary Care) in 2014 and was made deputy editor in 2018. BCS transitioned the journal to BMJ in January 2019 (as BMJ Health & Care Informatics), and I was appointed as interim editor for the first year. I hope to make the journal an attractive channel for implementer reports, replication studies, and patient-led content. BCS was also pivotal in the formation of the Professional Record Standards Body for health and social care (PRSB), a clinically-led group for information standards. I have been involved with PRSB from the outset and now serve as a non-executive director and chair of its Assurance Committee. I have tried to ensure that PRSB continues to express its independent professional voice, especially if national policy initiatives are incoherent. I was recently promoted to Reader in Health Informatics at the University of Portsmouth, but also took a temporary reduction in my academic contract to return to the NHS part- time as an enterprise architect, giving 50% of my time to each role. The chance to work again at the frontline with clinicians and service managers is hugely rewarding. Combining the two roles is a career high point for me. It is now twenty-five years since my three-month NHS contract started! One key lesson for me is the power of human networks: the synergy I have found in my various roles in HL7, BCS, PRSB, EFMI, and IMIA has been crucial. Without doubt, it has been an amazing opportunity that has taught me so much and brought me into contact with great people and given me the chance to contribute something useful. ", "Brigitte S\u00e9roussi": "IMIA Vice President and Editor-in-Chief, IMIA Yearbook (2012 \u2013 present). Associate Professor Sorbonne University, Paris, France . I was born in Tunis, Tunisia, and nothing predisposed me to research activities in Health Informatics. When my parents immigrated to France, I went to a French public school, and was a very diligent student. After a most competitive exam, I was accepted in the highly selective \u201cEcole Centrale Paris\u201d, an institute of research and higher education in engineering and science B. S\u00e9roussi, MD, PhD, FIAHSI (one of the top three French \u00ab Grandes Ecoles \u00bb). I also received a Master\u2019s in Computer Science at the University Paris 6 (with a major in Artificial Intelligence) and a PhD in Biomathematics at the University Paris 7. Since a young age, I had always been attracted by the life sciences. Thus, in parallel with my biomedical informatics studies, I also studied medicine at the University Paris 5 and graduated in General Practice. In this way, I was a precursor in following a mixed curriculum combining computer sciences, mathematical modeling, and medical studies. Thanks to my double education, I could be as comfortable with the fuzzy, uncertainty, and incompleteness specific to medical practice as with the rigor of logics and formal analysis I was used to prior to my medical studies, which are too, and so much appreciated. I combined these two antagonistic ways of thinking to model, develop, and implement clinical decision support systems (CDSSs). I followed the various trends of decision support developments from data-based Bayesian systems, to expert systems using the cognitive-symbolic paradigm of Artificial Intelligence, to guideline-based decision support systems following evidence-based medicine principles. Another dimension of my work has been to assess the impact of CDSSs on clinicians\u2019 behavior, including the understanding of why these tools sometimes fail to achieve their goals beyond usability issues (especially the role of reactance or the impact of automation bias). Everything started during my medical studies, when I had the opportunity to experience training periods at the laboratory of Biophysics headed by Fran\u00e7ois Gr\u00e9my at the Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re hospital in Paris. I had the chance to be close to him at the moment he made some great contributions to the development of Medical Informatics worldwide. Fran\u00e7ois Gr\u00e9my was an admirable humanist, strongly engaged in social equity and solidarity and against any clinical form of discrimination. He was also a really funny person. I would always remember his answer when I told him he was the icon of Medical Informatics: he laughed and simply told me \u201cfaut-pas diconer\u201d which means \u201cthis is really bullshit\u201d but using the word \u201cicon\u201d and distorting it to get close to \u201cd\u00e9conner\u201d (which means \u201ctalk non sense\u201d in a very familiar French). I really enjoyed working with him at this time and afterwards. I used to be part of the Department of Medical Informatics of University Paris 6 headed by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Boisvieux (when Fran\u00e7ois Gr\u00e9my moved to Montpellier). I started to work on medical decision-making at the end of the 1980s using numerical (probabilistic) methods for the diagnosis of acute abdominal pain (taking a Bayesian  approach under the assumption of independent clinical signs, in a way similar to de Dombal\u2019s work, but with the application of the Lancaster model to account for order-2 interactions between signs). I was thrilled by the results of the algorithm I developed, but I realized very quickly that decision support only based on data could not be sustainable because the sole display of probabilities could not convince health practitioners in the long term. That is why, I rapidly moved towards symbolic approaches where the traces of the reasoning process could be used as explanations provided in natural language. Thus, my work evolved towards the development of so-called \"knowledge-based\" systems. These systems, supposed to be able to simulate the reasoning process of experts, have as their main characteristics the use of domain knowledge to infer certain conclusions or actions from data or facts. I used this approach for the system SEPIA applied to the monitoring of patients hospitalized in hemato-oncology departments to manage the critical episodes of acute illness that frequently occur due to the high toxicity of the antimitotics used in chemotherapy protocols. The originality of this approach had been to model the knowledge base according to the principles of the control theory of dynamic systems and to represent the patient condition with state variables continuously updated as new monitored data were recorded. In the late 1990s, I coordinated the European project DOME (# MLAP-63221) which had as its aim to study whether natural language processing tools and document systems could help in the development and processing of medical reports. This project allowed us to test how structuring an electronic health record with hypertextual links between relevant reports and notes could help a physician assess a patient condition in an efficient way. We organized focus groups during the project that emphasized how much physicians were attached to their work habits and were willing to continue to benefit from the expressiveness of natural language and textual reports. However, they were also very much interested in the benefits of digitalization to improve the structuring of medical reports and, consequently, information retrieval from patient care records. At a time when all existing electronic medical records were data-based, the DOME project made me understand that a patient is more than the sum of his/her data, and that textual observations are far richer than a set of parameters. This analysis underlines the fact that the formalization of medical knowledge is limited and that the operationalization of formalized medical knowledge is by construction biased: the loss of context when describing a patient\u2019s condition by a set of data alone is indeed prejudicial to the understanding of the complete picture of the problem that has to be solved. On the basis of this observation, and in collaboration with Jacques Bouaud (researcher at the Medical Informatics Department of the Assistance Publique \u2013 H\u00f4pitaux de Paris), we proposed a documentary approach to medical decision-making that we applied to improve the implementation of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). In order to preserve the flexibility in interpreting CPGs, we proposed to delegate the knowledge interpretation task to the physician at the moment of the decision, when the context of the patient is available. Our proposal relies on both formal and informal principles and is halfway between knowledge representation and text reading. On the formal side, the clinician is proposed a structured knowledge base (KB) encoded as a decision tree with formal properties which guarantee the completeness in guideline coverage and the uniqueness of solutions. However, the KB is not expected to be automatically run on data but read by the clinician who has the opportunity of interpret the guideline knowledge for a given patient when navigating through the decision tree. At each depth level of the decision tree, the clinician is asked about a clinical parameter and has to answer taking into account the clinico-psycho-sociological reality of the  patient. At the leaf level, (s)he may choose among the proposed therapeutic recommendations. The approach has been initially developed with the CDSS OncoDoc scheme applied to the management of breast cancer patients. The system has been used routinely in multidisciplinary tumor boards (MTBs) and showed a positive impact on clinical practice (increase of the compliance rate with CPGs of MTB decisions). This approach has also been applied to the management of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia. However, if the implementation of CPGs in CDSSs is to be useful for providing clinicians with best patient-centered recommendations to manage a given pathology, it is not sufficient to improve care quality and overall public health since multimorbidity is common. Thus, we recently have developed GO-DSS, a CDSS that relies on an ontological-based reasoning method to manage patients with multiple pathologies from single-disease guidelines. Given the growing adoption of health information technology tools (electronic health records, computerized physician order entry systems, and decision support systems), and given the increasing use of social media, as well as the growing wave of the Internet of Things (wearables and quantified self), we are entering an era of Big Data. Based on this data, machine learning (especially deep learning) is providing daily new astounding results. The future is thus in the data. Of course, guideline-based decision support systems would maintain their role of helping physicians improve their decisions, but what would be the meaning of guidelines, evidence-based medicine, and clinical research when the time that medical knowledge doubles is 73 days as is projected to be the case by 2020? I think that we are entering into an era of all-encompassing data, and all health systems, including decision support systems, will be data-based according to the evolving learning health systems paradigm. To manage a patient characterized by some clinical parameters, the process will be to search for similar patients in big data warehouses, to assess the treatments and the clinical outcomes of the treatments they have received, and to propose different scenarios to the patient \u2013 and practitioner. Medicine will definitively become 4P medicine: preventive, predictive, participative, and personalized\u2026if we manage to get it right!

Another main contribution is on health information standards which follow from the IHRB concept. I was born in 1957 in Jerusalem and carried out academic studies in Biology, Mathematics and Computer Sciences at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem culminating in a PhD. In postdoctoral studies at the Georgia Institute of Technology, I specialized in case-based reasoning. I work for Philips as a health informatics specialist, focusing on data harmonization. Previously I had worked at IBM Research where I co-founded and chaired the Medical Informatics Community and headed the IBM program on healthcare & life sciences information standards. In the professional medical informatics field, I have established and chaired the following working groups: IMIA Working Group on Health Record Banking and the EFMI Working Group on Translational Health Informatics. I am also a founding member of the recently established International Academy of Health Sciences Informatics. I have led key standardization activities: established and co-chaired the HL7 Clinical Genomics Work Group (2003-2018) and am co-editor of the Clinical Document Architecture (CDA), Continuity of Care Document (CCD), the Family Health History (Pedigree) and the Genetic Testing Report (GTR) standards. I was elected an HL7 Fellow. I specialize in longitudinal and cross-institutional Electronic Health Records and am a pioneer of the Independent Health Record Banks vision. In the early 1990\u2019s I founded and managed a start-up with the Hadassah Medical Organization developing applications in the area of patient simulations. I started toying with the IHRB idea around 1997 when I finished my postdoc research. During that research, I\u2019ve been focusing on cased-based reasoning and I thought it to be a crucial methodology for clinical decision support because rule-based reasoning doesn\u2019t really work in medicine. I then looked for ways to create medical case-bases with cases that are as rich & complete as possible. I realized that the fact that each provider is the record keeper of the records it created is a major obstacle because the \u2018case\u2019 as persisted by a provider is typically incomplete since other pieces of the patient\u2019s medical \u2018puzzle\u2019 reside in other provider\u2019s information systems. I then founded a start-up company to create such a case base and provide a service for patients to look for similar cases to their own in an attempt to identify successful treatments and possibly providers who were successful in providing those treatments. The start-up had a nice business plan (focused initially on aggregating annual check-up results) but it got rejected by venture capitalists in Israel. They all argued that due to an anticipated lack of cooperation on the healthcare providers\u2019 side \u2013 the business is not going to take off\u2026 I then realized that first there is a need for a change in the existing  regulations and I turned to deal mainly with the ethical and legal aspects of IHRB rather than the business and technological ones. I focused on the characteristics of these new entities mainly with regard to their independence, and the medico-legal status of the medical records IHRBs persist. When I joined IBM Research, we started working with the T.J.Watson Research Centre on the Shaman project and I then started publishing my IHRB radical vision where the ethical independency is emphasized as well as the requirement for the medico-legal record to be archived only in IHRBs. The first publication was my presentation at the TEHR 2001 in London, and this was the first full publication of this vision, where a complete reorganization of the current constellation of stakeholders was detailed and substantiated. The most significant milestone was the introduction of a bill entitled \u201cIndependent Health Record Banks\u201d in the 110th US Congress. Even though this bill is not identical to my vision, it is still a step in this direction as the legislators were influenced by my publications, and I was invited to speak to the Congressional Policy Staff in 2017. The main IHRB Principles are: \u2022 The Independent Health Record Banks (IHRB) vision suggests that medical records will not be kept anymore by healthcare providers; rather they will be sustained for the entire lifetime of an individual by new players in the healthcare industry- IHRBs - which will be (1) independent of healthcare providers / insurers / government-agencies / patients and (2) regulated by new legislation. \u2022 The fundamental principle of the new legislation is that the copy of a medical record stored in such an EHR bank is the only medico-legal copy. The record is sustained objectively by an EHR bank and all authorized parties can have access to it. Such a bank acts as a custodian/trustee. Multiple competing banks will be established by private enterprises (once the appropriate legislation is put in place), much like financial banks. \u2022 Healthcare providers could reduce their costs for medical record archiving as this function will be carried out by the EHR banks. Insurers will support it as it will improve the quality of care their customers get. Privacy will be better protected as no global patient identifiers will be needed since a bank account number will be the only access key that the individual needs. And most importantly, true longitudinal EHRs will finally come out of the raw attested medical records by advanced information technologies employed by the EHR banks. \u2022 Towards a compositional health information language. \u2022 After about twenty years of developing standards within HL7 without significant adoption and more importantly\u2014without evidence that those standards address the lack of interoperability of information systems, I\u2019ve proposed the following vision for moving ahead on health information standards.  \u2022 First, let's distinguish between medical terminologies and other information structures where terminologies are being used. Regarding the latter, we can see three main types: \u2022 API specifications: a good example is FHIR that has discrete resources and operations, best used in systems communicating via APIs, i.e., it is not the typical interoperability situation where disparate systems attempt to exchange information without shared context; \u2022 Clinical documents: the best example is the CDA specification and the main use case is to accommodate medico-legal requirements and provide contextual information framework to the attestation of responsible clinicians to the recorded data; \u2022 Health records: the best example is 13606 and openEHR, and in fact it's probably the only example. Note: I ignored the message type because the gist of semantics is typically captured in the payload of the message, while the latter is mainly an \u2018envelope\u2019 or a protocol specification. The above three structure types overlap and each claim to cover most types of data. In addition, some terminologies are expanding to be ontologies (e.g., SNOMED) and have notations that overlap with some elements of the structures where the codes need to be utilized. All in all, there's a lot of confusion in the field of health information standards, but more importantly\u2014there's frustration after so many huge investments in standards implementation that didn't lead to the promised semantic interoperability. One of the fundamental issues with actual implementation of standards is the rigidity of the structures, whether it's FHIR resource, CDA template or openEHR archetype. While trying to accommodate specific data requirements, often the structure doesn't fit all needs and is either skipped or extended in a way that cannot be understood by others and sometimes conflict with the base semantics. In addition, the use of terminologies results in a mix-up of incompatible elements, e.g., between the semantics of an HL7 attribute and the assigned SNOMED code. All these challenges led me to suggest in my MedInfo 2015 keynote speech that we actually need to start developing a compositional health information language, which is more similar to a natural language, and could replace the aforementioned structures and terminologies. The current nature of health information standards cannot accommodate the fast-changing knowledge on human health and so I envisioned that current standards will be phased out once such an integrative, self-reliant and coherent language will be made available. Finally, regardless of the exact format of standards, no stakeholder in the current constellation of longitudinal patient data has sufficient incentive to enforce the adherence of patient data to standards. To this end, another vision I mentioned during my MEDINFO 2015 speech is the constellation change to Independent Health Record Banks; such data bank organizations should have much more incentive to promote standards adherence among the various data sources and standardize incoming data sets that haven't been formatted properly, so that they can provide the true benefit of a coherent lifetime health record. ", "Yuval Shahar": "Y. Shahar, MD, PhD, FACMI, Josef Erteschik Chair (Information Systems Engineering) Head, Medical Informatics Research Center, BGU, Israel Temporal Reasoning, Temporal Data Mining, Therapy Planning; Knowledge Representation, Individual/Group Decision Making I feel very lucky to have lived through, and to still be living, in the current, exciting times. So much is happening in Medical Informatics in general, and in Artificial Intelligence in Medicine in particular, that I would not have wanted to miss it for anything! As a young boy in Jerusalem, Israel, I was mostly hooked on math, science, and puzzle books, and, in parallel, on magic as a major hobby. I was fortunate to MIAHSI have been tutored by a grandfather, an ingenious autodidact who taught himself, among other things, ten languages, and who taught me English. He also satisfied my curiosity by providing me with an endless supply of recreational mathematics and magic books (where could he have got hold of them in those days in Jerusalem, I shall never know). To improve my English, he cunningly provided me with a stream of excellent English-language books on both subjects, forcing me to continuously pore through a huge dictionary and thus enhance my vocabulary. I did not know anything about computers, though. What changed my life was a math summer camp at the Weizmann Institute, when I was 16 years old, in which we were taught to program a CDC computer using Fortran IV and colourful punch cards. It turned out that one could do anything by programming a computer - from computing the first 5,000 prime numbers, to programming the game of Life, a known cellular-automata game developed by John Conway! I was hooked forever. I told my father that eventually, I would like to study math and program computers in the university. Unfortunately, when he asked me \u201cbut what can one do with computers, except play with them, or solve exotic math equations, and how would you make a living doing that?\u201d I had no good answer. In the early 1970s, there wasn\u2019t even a real Computer Science department in Israel; the subject was usually a somewhat negligible track within Mathematics departments, and no High Tech company seemed to exist. I was forced to admit that I had no idea what could one possibly do with computers in real life, other than, perhaps, calculate electricity bills, but I was pretty sure that I would like to find out! When I finished high school in 1975, a year later, I decided to enroll in a special program for top students in which compulsory military service was delayed until an academic degree was obtained. However, I could not decide whether to try for medicine (a track that my parents and grandfather obviously very much hoped that I would pursue) or for math and computer science (a direction which, as much as I was fascinated by medical science, I had felt that I really must follow). I finally settled on enrolling in the Hebrew University\u2019s Medical School, while continuing in parallel, during the Basic Science years, to take some math and computer science classes. When I finished the six years of Medical school, I was assigned by the Internship Lottery to the Soroka Hospital,  Ben Gurion University\u2019s (BGU) academic medical center in Beer Sheva. I exploited the long medical-exams break between the sixth medical year and the internship to take a few math and CS courses at BGU, including an early Artificial Intelligence (AI) graduate course, in which I was introduced to McCarthy\u2019s cool LISP language\u2026. When I finally had to enlist for my compulsory military service, now as a physician, I served for a year as a medical officer in the infantry. I then persuaded the head of the Medical Corps, the Israeli Surgeon General, that I would be much more useful in the Medical Corps\u2019 newly created Section for Medical Informatics. There were positions in the Section for an engineer and a physician. I convinced the Medical Corps that they could save the cost of a whole full-time employee by first sending me to additional training in the Military Academy for Information Sciences (which, as things turned out, has produced since then much of Israel\u2019s Hi Tech community), including an eight-month Systems Analysis and Design course that involved working on a large real project, and then having me fill both the Engineer and the Physician slot. This argument seemed to work. Thus, a year later I became head of the Medical Informatics Section of the Medical Corps, whose employee roster at that point included only me and a young secretary in her first month of compulsory service\u2026 Fortunately, I happened to know, having just graduated from it, that the Academy was looking for a set of project topics for its next year\u2019s Systems Analysis and Design course. I proposed a modest (??) project for the whole next class of System Analysts and Designers: computerizing the core tasks of the whole Medical Corps, and in particular, designing an Electronic Medical Record (EMR), and building a system for optimization of the evacuation and distribution (among multiple medical centers) of injured patients during emergencies. Not having other options, I proposed to be the professional mentor of the course\u2019s 50 students, typically partitioned into seven independent teams. The Academy must have assumed that I would be supported by a large [??] administrative and professional staff. I did not attempt to either confirm or dispel that assumption. The project turned out to be the first milestone towards eventually computerizing the Medical Corps\u2019 EMR, and also created an architecture that has been used for many years for training and simulation of emergency situations. We even experimented with building a small expert system to optimize the distribution of casualties among the medical centers. The experience of leading the seven teams was invaluable. The Analysis and Design documents produced by them continued to guide me during the following three years, in which the Medical Informatics Section grew into the Medical Informatics Branch, now one of the two largest branches in the Medical Corps\u2019 headquarters. In parallel, I finally had some time to complete my computer science courses and pursue Math and Computer Science M.Sc. studies at nearby Bar Ilan University. I was mostly fascinated by Computability theory on one hand, and by AI on the other hand. At that point, I started hearing more and more about Ted Shortliffe, the MYCIN system, and Stanford University 1970\u2019s Heuristic Programming Project. I made up my mind to pursue a graduate degree in the USA that focused on AI. Eventually, when I finished my service in the Medical Corps and my studies at Bar Ilan, I was awarded a Fulbright Award in Natural Sciences and was accepted to the Yale CS graduate program. My general plan was to come to Stanford for post-doctoral studies. However, after a year at Yale, many changes took place, not the least of which was Roger Schank, the head of the AI program, transferring, along with some 25 graduate students and faculty members working with him, to Northwestern University, IL, setting up the Institute for the Learning Sciences. I did not want to move to Northwestern, and stayed behind with three or four students, working with Schank\u2019s colleague at Yale, Drew McDermott, in the  temporal reasoning and mobile robot planning group. After a year, I returned to my original plan, albeit with a twist, and decided to move to Stanford earlier than originally planned, to finish my graduate studies there. I will forever be indebted to Ted Shortliffe, for reacting quickly and supporting this rather unexpected change in plans. For my PhD dissertation at Stanford, I had created the knowledge-based temporal- abstraction (KBTA) methodology, which abstracts large numbers of raw, time-stamped data into a set of higher-level, context-sensitive abstractions such as \u201cdeteriorating renal functions\u201d or \u201cgrade II myelotoxicity, in the context of the patient\u2019s bone-marrow transplantation protocol\u201d. On graduating from Stanford, I was fortunate enough to obtain a 5-years NIH FIRST career award, being ranked first in the USA that year, to further extend the KBTA methodology and explore all of its myriad implications, such as those involving continuous monitoring, chronic-patient therapy, temporal information visualization, natural-language generation of text summaries of EMRs, and temporal data mining. At that point, I had a rather crucial insight, inspired by working in McDermott\u2019s mobile-robot planning group, and in particular, by working on Jim Firby\u2019s Reactive Action Packages (RAPs) architecture. I had decided to focus on continuous automated monitoring and evidence-based therapy planning for chronically ill patients. I had now realized that, just like the robotic automated-planning domain, the clinical therapy- planning domain requires a library of established plans represented in a formal language, with clearly defined goals and entry conditions, with the plans activated dynamically as a situation arises, possibly based on the detection of a meaningful event or, more interestingly, a temporal pattern. These established plans, in the case of the medical domain, were, of course, evidence-based clinical guidelines. Furthermore, both the determination of which guideline should be used and how it should be applied, required the detection of meaningful, high level, clinical temporal patterns, often at a much higher level of abstraction than the input time-stamped, raw clinical data \u2013 i.e., KBTA patterns! I avoided mentioning my reactive-robots metaphors to my clinical colleagues, since they were quite likely to take them somewhat harshly; but they proved highly useful. Thus, during the time I had stayed on at Stanford\u2019s Section on Medical Informatics, first as a Senior Research Scientist, then as a full-time faculty member, I had followed, in parallel with my temporal-reasoning research, the insights I had obtained from the reactive-planning work at Yale. This was achieved by creating the Asbru formal guideline-specification language, together with two visiting European scholars \u2013 Silvia Miksch, a computer scientist from Austria, and Peter Johnson, a clinician and informatician from the UK. One of Asbru\u2019s innovations was a clear set of different types of process and outcome intentions, expressed as temporal-abstraction patterns to achieve, maintain, or avoid. Asbru was also the basis for our Asgaard project to support formal guideline specification, automated continuous application, and critiquing. After a decade at Stanford University, I moved back to Israel in 2000, to Ben Gurion University (BGU) and its new Department of Information Systems Engineering (now named Software and Information Systems Engineering), to found its Medical Informatics Research Center. Our first large project was, not surprisingly, designing and building the Digital Electronic Guideline Library (DeGeL). To continuously apply guidelines to chronic patients, we had built several guideline applications engines. The first of which, implemented by my student Ohad Young, was named Spock, inspired by the Star Trek character (i.e., a somewhat humourless entity that, nevertheless, is usually but annoyingly right). Spock was eventually extended by another student, Erez Shalom, into the more advanced Picard engine (inspired by Star Trek - The Next Generation).  In parallel, my BGU graduate students had also implemented a KBTA-based module that mediates between decision-support applications such as the Picard guideline- application engine, which often requires answers to high-level queries regarding clinically meaningful temporal abstractions, and clinical databases, which typically include only raw, time-stamped data. We referred to that generalized architecture as a temporal-abstraction mediator; the first mediator, implemented by David Boaz, was named IDAN (epoch, in Hebrew). IDAN was also used to power architectures such as Knowledge-based Navigation, Abstraction, Visualization and Exploration (KNAVE) of time-oriented clinical data of individual patients. KNAVE was eventually extended by Denis Klimov into an interactive temporal data-mining architecture for exploring longitudinal data and their abstractions of multiple patients, the VISITORS system. The temporal abstractions created by IDAN from the raw time-stamped clinical data were also useful as a basis for the CliniText natural-language generation system, implemented by Ayelet Goldstein, which produces natural-language text summaries of longitudinal databases, such as discharge letters from the ICU to an internal medicine ward. Furthermore, it turned out that the interval-based temporal abstractions generated by modules such as IDAN, can be further mined, to discover frequently repeating temporal patterns. As part of his PhD dissertation, Robert Moskovitch designed a highly efficient algorithm, KarmaLego, to perform that discovery. The discovered frequent patterns are also very useful features for classification and prediction using various machine-learning approaches, as we had demonstrated in several clinical domains. It also turned out that determining the optimal cut-off values used by the temporal abstractions, such for determining what is a High blood-glucose value in a certain context to optimally predict some outcome, can be learned not only from domain experts, as done in the original implementations of the KBTA method, but also automatically, when given sufficient longitudinal data. The interactive, user-driven, and the data-driven, machine-learning temporal data-mining modules were integrated nicely in an architecture implemented by Denis Klimov and Alex Shknevsky, which was successfully demonstrated by exploring temporal patterns predictive for developing, within five years, micro- and macro- albuminuria in type II diabetes patients. Finally, a combination of the DeGeL, Picard and IDAN architectures had powered the European Unions\u2019 5-country, 13-partner, \u20ac7M MobiGuide project, led by Israel, and coordinated by my Haifa University colleague and earlier post-doctoral scholar at our Stanford program, Professor Mor Peleg. Cardiac-arrhythmia patients in Italy and Gestational-Diabetes patients in Spain were monitored and automatically managed remotely, using sensors on the patients (e.g., ECG belts and blood-glucose monitors), the patients\u2019 smart phones, and a series of decision-support servers throughout Europe. The clinical pilots\u2019 results were encouraging, demonstrating the potential of automated, remote, evidence-based management of chronic conditions, integrating AI technologies (e.g., knowledge engineering, temporal reasoning) with Wearable Computing. I feel fortunate to have had a first-hand eye-witness view of several of the dramatic events as they were, and still are, happening in Medical Informatics in general, and in AI in Medicine in particular. The opportunities for AI in medicine, especially when integrated with new data-driven approaches, such as deep neural networks, are boundless. If I had to suggest one insight from my experiences, it would be: Try to pursue what you feel like a good idea to the end, even if it initially does not appear to demonstrate its full potential. If it is indeed a good one, it might eventually pleasantly surprise you. ", "Michael Shifrin": "My Journey to Medical Informatics My life in medical informatics (MI) began in late 1976, 3 years after finishing a post-graduate course at the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of the Moscow State Lomonosov University (MSU) in the department of differential equations, preparing of PhD thesis and work in the applied mathematics field. The transition to work in the field of MI was not something I planned in advance\u2014 it was determined by the opportunity to move to the team, in which my good friends worked and which was headed by the great mathematician, one of the leaders of world mathematics of the second half of the last century, I.M. Gel\u2019fand. I became a research associate of the famous Institute of Applied Mathematics, whose director was M.V. Keldysh (later the institute received his name), and where an amazing team of mathematicians, physicists, electronics engineers worked, and, more recently, A.D. Sakharov worked. Medical informatics was the occupation of the staff of the department headed by I.M. Gel\u2019fand, which was a part, as we would now say, of a virtual team consisting of MSU staff, several institutes of the USSR Academy of Sciences, and several medical institutions. The base on which we usually gathered for work was the Laboratory of Mathematical Methods in Biology of Moscow State University. My activity in MI can be divided into three periods related to the development of this area of knowledge: \u201cscientific\u201d, \u201cprofessional\u201d, and \u201ccivilian\u201d. Institute of Applied Mathematics \u2013 \u201cThe Scientific Period of Medical Informatics\u201d. Medical informatics in the USSR began, as in other countries, to form as a separate field of knowledge in the early 1950s, when the first attempts were made to apply methods of machine learning in medicine (in the Russian-language literature they were called \"pattern recognition,\" although speech rarely was about analyzing images). This was the period when MI was practiced by enthusiasts from among mathematicians, physicists and engineers, and the doctors involved in this occupation. The results were often of a research nature and were rarely used in clinical practice. In the USSR it was a unique time when scientists did not think about grants and could engage in innovative research without thinking about their financing. The team of I.M. Gel\u2019fand, which I joined, began to engage in medical tasks in the late 1960's. Quite quickly it was concluded that the most interesting direction is not just the application of methods of machine learning to the problems set by physicians, but searching for methods to identify and formalize medical experience. Over the next 20 years of work, a holistic approach to the use of formal methods in clinical medicine was developed, which followed three basic requirements: \u2022 the results should be useful to the doctor for making decisions regarding the treatment of a particular patient; \u2022 methods of analysis should use the knowledge and experience of clinicians; \u2022 the results should be as conclusive as the results of experiments in biology and psychology.  More details about this approach, which can be generalized as the \u201cmethod of adequate formalization,\u201d is described in a separate essay \u201cMedical Informatics \u2013 the Gelfand Approach.\u201d In the same reference there are a few words about the central hypothesis for this approach: hypothesis on the structural organization of data carried out by a doctor in search of an answer to clinical questions. This experience was summarized in the book Essays on the joint work of mathematicians and doctors. In the book, several clinical problems solved by our virtual team, were discussed in detail, but their presentation was not an end in itself: they illustrated different facets adequate for clinical medicine. One of the basic tools of the method of adequate formalization are \u201cdiagnostic games\u201d\u2014a method of modeling real clinical situations, which allows to identify and formalize medical decision algorithms. This method can be considered as complementary to the methods of evidence-based medicine, as it allows to make meaningful use of individual medical experience, almost completely rejected by evidence-based medicine. In addition, the method of diagnostic games is ethically flawless, so when using it, one never needs to make decisions in real clinical situations. Institute of Neurosurgery \u2013 \u201cProfessional period of medical informatics\u201d. The next phase of my research activities began in 1992 with the transition to the N.N. Burdenko Scientific Research Institute for Neurosurgery (NSI) to the position of head of the medical and mathematical laboratory, and continues to this day (since the end of 2016 as the head of the Department of Information Technology). NSI has been and remains the leading neurosurgical institution in Russia, in which patients with the most complex cases of neurosurgical pathology are concentrated, and a large number of scientific studies are conducted. This period of my work is connected with the transformation of MI from a purely scientific discipline into an instrument for the professional activities of doctors and the transition of medical informatics into the \"professional phase of our history\". My main task was to create an electronic medical record (EMR) for the NSI. In the mid-1990s, there was practically no EMR market in Russia, and it made most sense to create our own system. During the construction of the new NSI building, a modern information infrastructure was created and EMR e-Med was developed, gradually covering all the medical units of the Institute. In designing e-Med, we proceeded from two main points: \u2022 the system should facilitate the routine daily clinical work of the doctors; \u2022 the system should be implemented gradually and be able to evolve. After numerous discussions, a model was chosen, the basic element of which was not a medical document, as it was done in many hospital systems, but a working process. This approach was implemented in the MEDSET \u2013 web-based technology (Modeling, Engineering, Deployment, Support and Evolution Technology), covering all stages of the life cycle of the information system, from the initial information survey to implementation and evolution. This technology has allowed the development of a simple and securely extensible database schema. A sufficiently effective scheme for programming the user interface was developed, which allowed developing and operating e-Med for almost 20 years\u2014the first users started work in the system in the spring of 2000. At the same time, the system has been supported by a team consisting of no more than 4-5 people all these years, including a user support service almost round the clock. At the same time, information technology has progressed powerfully during this time. The interface capabilities became much richer; there was a need to create mobile versions of the system, and to integrate it with numerous information systems that did  not exist during the development of e-Med. In addition, e-Med appeared to suffer from all the shortcomings inherent in \u201chome-grown\u201d systems, and it was far from what is nowadays called a software product. Finally, available commercial systems appeared on the Russian market for information support of the diagnostic and treatment processes, so a need arose to move to a new platform for EMR. In \u201cOn a Seamless Transition from a Running EPR System to a New One\u201d in Seamless Care - Safe Care, the idea of a smooth transition from a running system to a new one without duplicating data input was proposed. Currently, this scheme is implemented, providing a gradual transfer of functions from e-Med to the new system. The use of information technology in the day-to-day activities of physicians stimulated their use in scientific work. In parallel with documenting the physician's medical work, the e-Med system was used to collect data for scientific work. E-Med technology allows a developer to create specialized databases for conducting specific studies, integrated with a common database. A number of clinical studies with a variety of design\u2014retrospective, using previously collected data, and prospective\u2014were conducted. On the basis of e-Med monitoring infectious complications in the intensive care unit was organized, which enabled a reduction in the number of cases of meningitis\u2014the most formidable of infectious complications developing after neurosurgical operations. National Center of Neurosurgery \u2013 \u201cCivil Period of Medical Informatics\u201d. The beginning of the 21st century was marked by many new developments in the field of information and communication technologies, which, as it is already clear, led to fundamental changes in society. First of all, it is the transformation of the Internet from an environment of getting information into an environment for communication and the possibilities for self-organization in societies. The individuals and groups within populations become active users of information technologies. In particular, not only researchers (as occured during the scientific stage) and not only health care workers (as occurred during the professional stage) become users of medical information technologies, unlike previous times, but the same is happening with an increasing number of patients and healthy citizens. Using information technology, they become active participants in the management of their health. Accordingly, new issues and problems arise in medical informatics. Understanding these new tasks is one of the main areas of my work at the present time. Particularly attractive are two areas: the comprehension of the tasks of medical informatics in the context of the rapidly developing 4P-medicine, and the analysis of the emerging \u201chealth ecosystem\u201d. 4P-medicine, which assumes a deep integration of medicine proper, as a science and art of healing, with fundamental biomedical research, is impossible without the use of information technology. I would venture to assume that it is on the path of 4P-medicine that information technologies will turn from an auxiliary medical tool into an integral part of it, and the synergistic interaction of medicine and information technologies will bring health care to a whole new level. Health and medical care will turn into health management. It is clear that many interesting and difficult tasks await the IT specialists on this path - and now it is necessary to look at how they stating their roles. In particular, the development of methods of artificial intelligence and the emergence of systems such as IBM Watson leads some experts to think about the possible withering away of many medical functions and the uselessness of many skills such as auscultation. To some extent, this can be fair, but there is not yet a replacement for the physician as an integrator of all the information flows that are available to him for making a specific clinical decision. An experienced doctor can take \u201ceverything\u201d into  account\u2014from the results of the operation of artificial intelligence systems to the patient's emotions. And in this respect, the role of the individual experience of the doctor does not diminish, and the task of identifying and transmitting it remains urgent. In this regard, it is of interest to return to the method of diagnostic games, but on the basis of modern communication technologies and openEHR tools. Speaking about the ecosystem of health, it should be noted that ecosystems of any nature are inconceivable without strong processes of self-organization, which, in our case, have so far been little studied. There are some examples of systems that can be considered as tools for self-organization for different parts of the health ecosystem. The most obvious examples are different patient Internet communities. Less obvious are some systems of personal medical records (PHR). Independent medical data banks can be considered as a tool for self-organization of a community of medical organizations. Repositories of archetypes created on the basis of openEHR technologies are a tool for self-organization of the medical community. Finally, international standards can be interpreted as a tool for self-organization of the community of developers of medical information systems. Other examples can be cited, but they require a systematic understanding, and I think that this process may well engage me in the conceivable future. Another change that is happening right now is the transformation of the Neurosurgery Institute into the National Center for Neurosurgery, which provides methodological guidance to all of Russia's neurosurgery activities, With the modern development of information technologies, the task of forming a single information environment for neurosurgery is quite realistic. This is a difficult long-term task, closely connected with the ideas of 4P-medicine, and with the idea of an ecosystem of health. Conclusion. I am grateful to the fate that provided me the opportunity of a close communication and cooperation with such a remarkable scientist as I.M. Gel\u2019fand. He taught me and many others two most important things. The first is an understanding of how mathematical thinking can benefit a field as distant from mathematics as medicine, in which the personal skill of the doctor, his intuition, should be harmoniously combined with the accuracy of the natural sciences. The second is the understanding that the \"vagueness\" of medicine is due not to the fact that doctors are not familiar with mathematics and use it poorly in their work, but because mathematics is not yet ready (and maybe will never be ready) to become a language of medicine - following the behests of the classics of natural science. The human being and living systems as a whole are too complex for this. And the task of mathematicians and informatics specialists is to search for those areas of physician activities where they can be useful. I am grateful for the opportunity to work with many outstanding doctors who were open to new ideas and to make difficult contacts with people with completely different styles of thinking. I am grateful to fate for my friends and colleagues who have always been selfless in their work, and often acted as stern opponents, who do not allow me to slow my development. I am grateful to fate for my family, my wife, for many years of support in a variety of life situations. ", "David Spiegelhalter": "Winton Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk, Statistical Laboratory, Cambridge University Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit (1982 \u2013 2012) President, Royal Statistical Society, UK (2017 \u2013 present) From the early 1980s, I worked on decision- support systems in medicine, which used explicit probabilities for diagnosis and prognosis. The simplest were the \u2018na\u00efve\u2019 or \u2018idiot\u2019s Bayes\u2019 models which assumed findings were conditionally independent given the true diagnosis or prognosis, but logistic regression models were also used which damped down the over-confidence that tended to occur. There was a strong and (usually) good-natured rivalry between techniques based on formal probabilistic methods for so-called \u2018expert\u2019 or \u2018knowledge-based systems\u2019, and those arising in the computer science community that were more rooted in artificial intelligence and attempted to represent expert knowledge through a network of rules, with a separate \u2018inference engine\u2019 to control the reasoning process. The MYCIN team from Stanford were international leaders in this field with their system of \u2018certainty factors\u2019 to handle uncertainty in the rules. There was no rigid distinction between the approaches: techniques included everything from purely qualitative reasoning, through rather ad-hoc quantification, fuzzy logic, and attempts to use probabilities in a network of rules. It was a very exciting and competitive time, in which many disciplines were trying to establish authority. A Royal Statistical Society discussion paper (Spiegelhalter and Knill-Jones, 1984) brought the controversy into the statistical world, but this was outdated even by the time of its publication. Struggling with the problem of handling probability models on directed graphs of arbitrary size and complexity (and, crucially, being totally unaware of Judea Pearl\u2019s work in this area), I realised that Wermuth and Lauritizen (1983) provided a connection between probabilistic models on directed graphs and unconnected graphs: the latter had been established for some time as an elegant way of representing conditional independence relations in contingency tables (Darroch, Lauritzen and Speed, 1980). In th April 1984 I met Steffen Lauritzen at the 150 Anniversary celebrations of the Royal Statistical Society and told him that his work on graphical models was of fundamental importance to artificial intelligence. He did not seem to believe me, but he was kind enough to take me seriously enough to invite me to visit. So I took the long journey to Aalborg in the north of Jutland in Denmark. By a remarkable stroke of good fortune Steffen shared a department with a research team who were working on uncertainty in expert systems, and together we persuaded him that he should get involved. As a bonus, the Danish group finally introduced me to Pearl (1982) and Kim and Pearl (1983). These came as a shock: looking beneath the poor typescript revealed fundamental and beautiful ideas on local computation that made me doubt we could contribute more. But Pearl was working solely with directed graphs, and we felt the connection with undirected graphs was worth pursuing in the search for a general algorithm for probability propagation in arbitrary graphs.  I wrote to Judea who replied in a typically enthusiastic and encouraging way, and so at a 1985 workshop at Bell Labs I tried to put together his work with our current focus on triangulated graphs, clique separations, potential representations and so on (Spiegelhalter, 1986). Then in July 1986 I finally met Pearl in Paris, and we ended up in a pavement caf\u00e9 in the Latin quarter, with Judea drawing graphs on the paper napkin and loudly claiming that anyone could see that observations on a particular node rendered two others independent \u2013 grabbing a passer-by, Judea demanded to know whether this unfortunate Frenchman could recognise this obvious property, but the poor innocent man just muttered something and walked briskly away, pleased to have escaped these lunatics. Steffen and I finally published our algorithm based on embedding the directed graph in a triangulated undirected graph that could be represented as a tree of cliques (Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988), which has gone on to attract huge numbers of citations and formed the basis for efficient propagation of probabilities through arbitrary Bayesian networks. Then I switched to work on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods on graphical models, which led to the BUGS software. I look back on that time in the mid -1980s as perhaps the most exciting and creative period of my working life, continually engaged in a certain amount of friendly rivalry with Pearl and others, who always responded with characteristic generosity of spirit. ", "Mario Stefanelli (1945 \u2013 2010)": "By Riccardo Bellazzi, with contributions from Vimla Patel, Silvana Quaglini, and Ted Shortliffe After his graduation in Electrical Engineering, Mario Stefanelli started to work on the mathematical modelling of biological systems in the late 1970\u2019s, particularly on erythropoiesis. He developed ordinary differential equations and stochastic methods for simulations to support the diagnosis of anemia. Collaborating with hematologists like Dr. Gianni Barosi and other clinicians, he sought to better understand their approaches to the disease, and to help them formalize their decision-making strategies (Barosi et al, 1981). Mario\u2019s deep interest in problems of diagnostic reasoning motivated him to carry out research on decision support systems by leveraging the growing field of artificial intelligence in medicine. Since US universities were the leaders in this field, Mario decided to visit and spend some time in one of the labs driving AI research, so as to learn and to design a coherent research plan for the future. Thanks to a NATO fellowship, he visited Casimir Kulikowski\u2019s lab at Rutgers University, where he deepened his insights and understood the need and timeliness of starting initiatives in Europe. After returning to Italy, Mario was energized to work in parallel along a number of initiatives. First, he founded a Medical Informatics Laboratory at the University of Pavia. Around this same time, he started collaborating with Prof. Lorenzo Magnani of the School of Philosophy, to provide a more complete and coherent epistemological design for the system he conceived. Finally, he started a European initiative in AI in medicine, and in 1985 organized and hosted the first AI in medicine meeting in Europe, held in Pavia called AIME (Artificial Intelligence in Medicine), which has been subsequently held biennially since 1987. Mario\u2019s ideas resulted in a general architecture for medical expert reasoning, which he called the Select and Test, or ST-model. He developed and tested expert systems for Anemia and Neoanemia based on this model, and the GAMES (General Architecture for Medical Expert Systems) European project extended the epistemological model of medical reasoning from diagnosis to therapy planning and monitoring (Lanzola et al, 1990, Ramoni et al 1992). Mario was highly motivated to cross disciplinary boundaries and carry out innovative interdisciplinary research. With this in mind, he introduced AI in medicine to the bioengineering community in Italy, showing how engineers could contribute to the field, pushing innovation by well-designed technological solutions. He organized AI and medical informatics schools at the Italian meeting of Bioengineering in 1988 and in 1996. In addition, Mario and his colleagues in Europe were among the first informatics scientists to recognize the importance of cognitive psychological studies for medical reasoning and the relationship developing expert systems (Patel et al, 1992), forging closer connections between cognitive science and engineering (Ramoni et al, 1995) and  Ramoni, Riva & Patel (1994). Their epistemological framework had considerable international impact in the cognitive science in medicine community, and the framework was tested against empirical data on medical reasoning at Patel\u2019s cognitive systems laboratory at McGill University in Montreal (Patel & Ramoni, 1997). During the first decade of the 2000\u2019s, Mario worked on embedding knowledge- based approaches in telemedicine systems and started the EC-funded Diabetes management project (Bellazzi R, et al 2002; Larizza et al, 2006). The combination of AI and interactive communication technologies signaled a new direction in Mario\u2019s work related to the design of complex telemedicine systems and a reconceptualization of the healthcare organization as a socio-technical environment (Stefanelli, 2001). This was the beginning of his work on novel decision-support systems centered on the concepts of careflow (workflows related to patient care) and proactive electronic guidelines (Stefanelli 2004; Panzarasa, 2002), as well as evidence-based careflow management systems for post-stroke rehabilitation (Azzini at al, 2003). Mario was most involved with the activities of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA). He thought that the international dimension was essential for the growth of the field and that a true involvement of all countries around the world is an invaluable source of knowledge for the field. After having been member of MEDINFO SPCs, his influential role within IMIA led to his appointment as SPC chair for MEDINFO-2004 together with Casimir Kulikowski. MEDINFO-2004 was widely recognized as one of the best IMIA conferences. Mario always fostered IMIA activities and worked with IMIA affiliated societies, including AMIA and EFMI. He was the first Italian to be elected as Fellow of the American College of Medical Informatics. Seven years after his death, Mario\u2019s work and concepts still remain current. The crucial role of patients\u2019 careflow has been finally recognized by health care and policy decision-makers. Rather interestingly, the importance of properly managing chronic care for patients is now translating into programs that, by integrating IoT, telemedicine, guidelines and routine care, may find in Mario Stefanelli\u2019s conceptual design a most appropriate conceptual paradigm. Moreover, precision medicine could benefit substantially by taking into account epistemological approaches, such as the ST-model, to better structure the reasoning mechanisms underlying the introduction of new strategies and therapies, thus complementing the pure analogical reasoning approach that seems to be the current paradigm. Finally, now that artificial intelligence is once again advancing forcefully, AIME can be seen as a most insightful precedent and a reference to pioneering work with a body of knowledge and experience generated over the years (Patel et al, 2009). If current Medical Informatics stands on the shoulders of giants, we can certainly say that Mario was one of them. ", "L\u0103cr\u0103mioara Stoicu-Tivadar": "Professor, Politehnica University, Timisoara President, Romanian Society of Medical Informatics (2010-2018) Vice-President, EFMI (2014-2018) Vice-President of HL7 - Romania (2016-2020) Chair, EFMI WG Healthcare Inf Interregional Cooperation Engineering, mainly computers and automation, were the modern approach to education in the 1980s in Romania, and the best choice for me, a sound alternative to medicine that was too realistic in terms of blood and flesh. But the idea to combine the two domains was always on my mind. After graduation, I had three years of experience in L. Stoicu-Tivadar, MSc, PhD industry and research, when in 1990, I started on an academic path, on which I am still wandering - still curious and enjoying the young people I meet every new academic year. My PhD work and thesis, naturally combining computer engineering and medicine, was defended in 1999 with the title \u201cSystemic aspects and integrated environments assisting cardiac diagnosis\u201d. It was my first cooperation with academics from the University of Medicine and Pharmacy Victor Babes from Timisoara, a cooperation that is still going today with different groups. An important moment in my personal story is the one of becoming a member of the Romanian Society of Medical Informatics in 1999, joining a group of professionals that proudly supported medical informatics and built its foundation: George Mihalas, Ioana Moisil, Dan D. Farcas, Mariana Bazavan, and Rodica Dimitriu. I made good friends and together, we actively participated and organized the next RSMI conferences. Together with colleagues from the big and best Romanian medical faculties, Diana Lungeanu, Marius Marusteri, Elena Podoleanu, Sorana Bolboaca, Gabriela Georgescu, Corina Vernic, Mircea Focsa we continue to build on these most essential collaborations. From both sides we grew young colleagues that are passionate about healthcare informatics and its new developments, and they will continue the good work. In 2003, a new adventure opened for me: all roads leading to Rome, I joined the European Federation of Medical Informatics Council and family in Rome, Italy. Professionally and at the human level EFMI was a great encounter. I met extraordinary people from all around the world, and I felt part of a great community. The Medinet sentinel dispensaries network in Romania is a great project I am proud to be part of. It was a unique national project during 2000-2004 when the Medinet stations network consisted in 100 computerized GP practices nation-wide, where doctors collected primary care data and sent it to a central server through the Internet. A team from the University Politehnica Timisoara (Vasile Stoicu-Tivadar, Dorin Berian, and me) developed the GP software MedINS and trained the doctors, a landmark for this type of application. The project manager was Marius Marginean, a dedicated and tough professional involved in many projects that modernized GP clinical practices. The experience we gained during the project consolidated our professional background immensely. There were challenges related to software development, one of them was how to import existing data bases into MedINS.. The data were almost the same but in a  very creative way from the 100 GPs, each of them introducing the data in the most imaginative formats: some had the name and surname in the same field, others had it in 2 fields, and addresses input beat them all in terms of imagination, also. The software solution was a great one and all the GPs had to do was to send us the floppy (yes, there was a time when such devices were in use, maybe some of the readers know only the save icon without its real meaning) and using the smart software, the database was imported very quickly in the required format. A GP had at that time 1500-7000 patients on their list. The one with 7000 was horrible to do, but there were villages in mountains that were facing such a situation. Luckily the mountain people have generally better health than most others! Another challenge was training of the GPs. There were 3 rounds: general computer operation/use training, MedINS training and Internet training. The experience with the GPs spanned a wide range, from people that hoped that one key would solve all the work to dedicated doctors who helped in a major way to build a user friendly software that was greatly appreciated. Our conclusion at the time and for the future was that if you do not involve doctors in the development of a software support it will be very hard to build a real tool and the degree of acceptance will be low. In medical education, all the medical faculties in Romania have in their curricula lectures of Medical Informatics and statistical processing. The most important technical faculties have in their curricula lectures or specialties related to the field of medicine. University Politehnica Timisoara has a long tradition using computers and electronics in the medical domain (Dan Farcas, Vasile Baltac in the 1960s, Anton Policec in the 1980s). During the 1990s the Faculty of Automation and Computers introduced in its curricula biomedical engineering packages including medical informatics, biomedical engineering, medical imaging, telemedicine, etc. I am especially proud of the the Master\u2019s Degree in Healthcare Information Systems managed by my department. Master\u2019s in Healthcare Information Systems, which started in 2009 as a unique type of Master \u2018s program to bring together engineers, informaticians, physicians, electronic engineers, economists around the medical domain, creating a common platform. Since then it has had challenging times, but now we are glad that the team is growing, and the Master\u2019s degree is more and more attractive to students. I am coordinating the academic activities for it and keep the faith that together with our medical colleagues it will build the foundation to modernise the medical system regionally and to make it a meaningful part of the domain in Europe. My current work, in a team of colleagues and PhD students (Mihaela, Oana, Norbert, Ioan, Stelian), is focused mainly on three directions: Virtual Reality applications in medicine, ontologies supporting the diagnosis and treatment in obstetrics-neonatology- paediatrics, and IoT applied in medicine. Based on our good cooperation with medical colleagues we intend to consolidate the results using Big Data benefits, smart analytics, and Cloud Computing for better doctor-patient team results. The developments in VR are focused for now mainly on education, and in the future we will extend it to clinical practice, considering that the use of these new tools will gain the acceptance of the medical staff. We as a team will encourage and work in the education domain in the medical informatics field as the need for the young generation of doctors is to be familiar with IT tools that will support their work and make it easier in a rapid changing world, with results from medical research coming quickly and reflecting the diversity of results from a multitude of sources. The main tools we use for new developments are Leap motion and Oculus, and interaction is done by gestures.  As far as my past work is concerned, from 2005 to 2015, I had results in continuity of care, integration, and development of models and software systems that support these concepts. As everybody (except in general, politicians) knows, independent and isolated software in medicine does not return benefits. The ICT benefits relate to communication and integration of data. I investigated the field of Ambient Assisted Living as a domain full of possibilities and benefits for health challenged people and for seniors. The research was developed in two nationally important projects: SIMIMED \u2013 Integrated system for medical data management using HL7 standards, and TELEASIS \u2013 Complex system on NGN support for seniors\u2019 homecare, 2007-2010. I acted as evaluator expert for the EHR project in Serbia in 2008 with Serbian colleagues working hard for an excellent project that unfortunately was not continued to its full potential due to political reasons at the time. For the same domain I acted as expert in the EU project CASA (2014- 2015). I cooperated in projects and activities with industry, had the privilege to be invited as a speaker for the IBM Academic Days in Romania (Bucharest, 2008) and Europe (Milan, 2014) ,and developed projects with companies, like Syonic from Timisoara. In the future I intend to develop more on systems medicine, taking the opportunity of being a member in the EU COST project Action CA15120, Open Multiscale Systems Medicine (OpenMultiMed) having as target the development and evaluation of a transdisciplinary framework for multiscale systems medicine, consisting of novel concepts, methodologies and technologies. Currently, I act as Vice president of the European Federation of Medical Informatics in charge of Working Groups. EFMI WGs are a great opportunity to aggregate research from Europe on specific domains. I focused on consolidating the groups and marketing their activities at national and European levels. I would also like to see each senior member train a successor to ensure continuity of good work. I chaired EFMI conferences, STC 2011 in Slovenia, co-chaired 2014 in Hungary and the greatest experience was as SPC chair in MIE2015 Madrid. It was challenging in many ways, and we had great keynote speakers, a full program of good presentations and a volume worth reading. I gathered a team of young people that enjoyed the EFMI society and hopefully they will build further on healthcare informatics and its supporting associations, EFMI and IMIA. International Journal of Medical Informatics, 2006; 75:335-342 ", "Diarmuid UaConaill (1941 \u2013 2018)": "I graduated in 1962 with a B.Sc. in Biochemistry from University College, Cork (U.C.C.), a constituent college of the National University of Ireland. My first job was a research posting at St. Joseph's Children's Hospital in Temple Street, Dublin, where I had to assess the precision and accuracy of the Beckman Spinco Ultramicro analytical system. Standard deviations were calculated using an electromechanical calculator\u2014electronics were not generally available in 1963! I returned to U.C.C., completing my M.Sc. in Biochemistry there in 1965, and was promptly employed in the Biochemistry laboratory of the Luton and Dunstable Hospital in Bedfordshire, England. After almost three years there I returned to Dublin to take charge of the biochemistry laboratory at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital. My boss there, Prof. Maurice Hickey, was interested in laboratory computing, and sent me to assess computer systems at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, England; at BUPA's laboratories in Harley Street, London; and at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast, Northern Ireland. These early laboratory computer systems impressed me, and I could see how much they could contribute to throughput and quality control. I made a case to the hospital management in 1968. It was to be 20 years before we actually got a system installed. In the meantime, I was appointed to the hospital's Computer Committee, where I served as Honorary Secretary until I retired in 2003. In 1971, I was promoted to Consultant Biochemist, still at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital. About that time, I acquired a Casio programmable electronic calculator for the laboratory. It proved its worth in time saved on complex calculations and taxed my ingenuity in making the most of its 20 program steps. These limitations were greatly overcome the following year, when we acquired a Wang PCS2 computer. It had 4K of internal memory apart from the operating system, and two floppy-disk drives\u2014no hard disk. It used the BASIC programming language, and I and others of my staff grew adept at circumventing the limited memory by writing programs in short sections that could be chained and called from the floppy disk one at a time. Programming fascinated me, so in 1974, I signed up for a City and Guilds of London course in Basic Computer Programming, at the Dublin Institute of Technology in Bolton Street. I completed the two-year course and gained the certificate in a single year. For practical work we used a Digital PDP-8 computer. Each time we fired it up we had to set in the bootstrap program on toggle switches, using octal. Output was on a Teletype, producing great lengths of punched paper tape as well as printout. Pursuing this interest, in August 1975 I attended a summer-school in Medical Informatics organised by Prof. Peter Reichertz at the Medizinische Hochschule in Hannover, Germany. My circle of contacts in the field was widening, and when the Healthcare Specialist Group of the Irish Computer Society was formed in 1976, I was  soon invited to join. I served on the Executive Committee for many years thereafter, including terms as Honorary Secretary and Chairman. In 1980, I replaced Prof. Rory O\u2019Moore as Irish representative to IMIA. Irish hospitals were beginning to develop computer systems, mainly for Accounts and Personnel; and the Irish government policy was to select a single provider and a single system for all hospitals. They favoured a particular American company; and early in 1983 the Mater Misericordiae Hospital sent a team to assess the systems of this and another company in the eastern United States. I was a member of the team, and we visited hospitals in Brooklyn NY, in Raleigh and Charlotte NC, in Shreveport LA and in Orlando and Fort Lauderdale FL. Our report favoured the rival company over the government's preference, a choice that probably contributed to the delays in acquiring a system. The professional bodies concerned with clinical laboratories, the Academy of Medical Laboratory Science (AMLS), the Association of Clinical Biochemists in Ireland (ACBI) and the Faculty of Pathology of the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland (FP- RCPI) wished to bring their views on laboratory computer systems to the attention of the government Department of Health (DOH). To this end, about 1985, they formed the Liaison Committee on Hospital Laboratory Computing. I was one of the ACBI representatives on the committee and served as Chair for many years. Our first project was to prepare a document, \u201cRecommended Standards for Hospital Laboratory Computer Systems\u201d. I wrote the first draft, and after much work the document was published in Diarmuid UaConaill at MEDINFO 2004 booklet form in 1986. I seem to remember (though I have no supporting documentation) that it was also adopted by a sister organisation in Spain. The Liaison Committee worked with the DOH on this and on Data Protection and Workload Measurement. In 1993, we published a revised version of our Recommended Standards, under the title \u201cGuidelines for Hospital Laboratory Computer Systems\u201d. This was considered at EFMI. Meanwhile in my own laboratory, we became acquainted with Apple and IBM personal computers, and I had ample opportunity to develop my programming skills. At one point I wrote a program in assembly language to customise the reports from our Technicon SMA-12/60 multi-channel analyzer. The hospital's systems advanced slowly, and at last in 1988 we acquired a TelePath laboratory computer system, marketed by SMS. One of the things I liked best about it was that I had access to the source code, and the proprietors allowed me to add to the functionality, even incorporating some of my modifications into their standard product. I was involved in the implementation in all the Pathology departments\u2014Biochemistry, Haematology, Endocrinology, Immunology, Microbiology, Histopathology and Transfusion.  The hospital's patient information system was also supplied by SMS, and in the early 1990s we pioneered an Order Communications and Results Reporting (OCRR) system developed by the company. This worked very well, cutting out much of the laborious manual data entry and reducing errors. It was installed first in the \u201cnumeric\u201d disciplines (Bio, Haem, Endo, and Immuno). Later, in consultation with SMS, I extended it to Microbiology and Histopathology. Transfusion resisted the development, because of established standards requiring manual signatures on documents. From around 1990, the Healthcare Specialist Group grew inactive. Late in 1994, I was approached by the Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland, asking whether the HCSG would help to form a section on Medical Informatics within the Academy. Tony Carroll and I were among the Irish delegates attending Medinfo 95 in Vancouver BC, and the Canadian experience fired us with a new enthusiasm to revitalise the HCSG. We reconvened, appointed a new Executive Committee, and decided to set up a new society, the Healthcare Informatics Society of Ireland (HISI). After discussions with the relevant bodies, HISI was established incorporating the Medical Informatics section of the Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland and affiliated to the Irish Computer Society. I continued to represent the society at IMIA, which accepted HISI's membership at the general Assembly in Sydney, Australia, in 1997. Not long after the Y2K scare, I was invited to join a committee of the GP-IT Group to define standards for electronic transmission of messages between hospital laboratories and general practitioners. This committee moved slowly, and meanwhile the national HealthLink project got under way. I was not personally involved in that, and it did not impact on my laboratory, as the reports to the GPs were drawn from the hospital's Patient Information system, having been transmitted from the laboratories via OCRR. I retired from the Mater Misericordiae Hospital in 2003 and set up a consultancy. I gained a contract to support the hospital's laboratory systems, a task that also involved taking part in a government procurement exercise for hospital lab computer systems. My second contract was to write a series of interfaces to HealthLink from TelePath systems in hospitals that did not have OCRR. This work continued until I retired fully in 2010. In 2003, I took up the position of IMIA Secretary, and served until 2009, under three presidents, K.C. Lun, Nancy Lorenzi and Reinhold Haux. The existence of the secretariat and the Executive Director made the job of Secretary much simpler, and I had great support throughout my tenure from Steven Huesing, and later Peter Murray. I was left with so little to do that I turned my attention to the Statutes of IMIA, and drafted revisions to bring them into line with current practice. After discussion and modification, these were accepted at the General Assembly 2010 in Cape Town, South Africa. At that General Assembly I stepped down as HISI representative to IMIA; and in the same year I wound up my consultancy and went into full retirement. I continued to work with the IMIA Archives Taskforce, and I continued on the Executive Committee of HISI until 2012. When I stood down, the society very kindly awarded me the O'Moore Medal for my contributions. ", "Jan H. van Bemmel": "Time Flies In 1966, my interest in the not yet extant field of medical informatics was much intensified by attending the very first European conference on computers in medicine in Elsinore, Denmark. This conference was held close to the same place where Hamlet was thought to have spoken the famous words: \u20182B or not 2B\u2019. It was in Elsinore where I met for the first time Homer Warner from Salt Lake City and Hubert Pipberger from Washington DC. The latter had started the computer processing of electrocardiograms a few years earlier. From then on, I started collaborating with Hubert, which lasted many years. This type of cooperation shows that making international bridges is of great importance for scientific research and one of the great advantages of an association like IMIA. Junior researchers are able to meet and start collaborations with more experienced people from all over the world. This is the very reason why IMIA started working conferences and MEDINFO world conferences. In a way, they can be considered as marketplaces, where knowledge and experience are being exchanged and \u2018traded\u2019. IMIA. Having started in 1963, with my background in physics, using computers for biomedical research and clinical applications, I received in 1967 a grant from WHO to investigate the state of affairs of computers in European hospitals. I made a long study tour along hospitals and research laboratories in several European countries and wrote a comprehensive report called \u2018Computers in European Hospitals\u2019. It was during this study tour to several European cities (from Geneva and Paris to Stockholm and London) that I met for the first time Fran\u00e7ois Gr\u00e9my in Paris. After that, I never lost contact with Fran\u00e7ois. He too was, just like me, very interested in using computers, foremost for biomedical research. Fran\u00e7ois, having joined the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP), chaired the so-called Technical Committee 4 (TC-4) for medical information processing, the forerunner of IMIA, which was established in 1977. The first MedInfo conference was organized by TC-4 in Stockholm, even before the field of \u2018medical informatics\u2019 was invented or IMIA established. It was also the time to bring some order to this rapidly diversifying field, resulting in the development of a model for medical information processing. Yearbooks. In 1970, together with Jan Roukens, I established in the Netherlands one of the first European professional societies in medical informatics, the Society for Medical and Biological Information Processing. Jan Roukens became its first chairman, and I became its second. Since the first MedInfo conference, I have been active in all following MedInfos, such as the editorship of the Proceedings of MedInfo \u201983 in Amsterdam, together with Marion Ball (USA) and Ove Wigertz (Sweden), and chairing the scientific program committee of MedInfo \u201986 in Washington, DC, together with Ted Shortliffe, and with Don Lindberg as the Organizing Committee chairman. Over the following years I had the privilege of organizing several working conferences and editing a series of books in the framework of IMIA. A most interesting period was the editing of IMIA\u2019s  Yearbooks, a job done together with Alexa McCray (USA), and with the help of many other colleagues, during the years 1992\u20132000. After this, Reinhold Haux (FRG) and Casimir Kulikowski (USA) took over the editorship of the IMIA Yearbooks. In 1998, I became president, responsible for steering the ship of IMIA for a period of three years, after many predecessors: David Shires, Canada; Hans Peterson, Sweden; Shigekoto Kaihara, Japan; Jos Willems, Belgium; Marion Ball, USA; and Otto Rienhoff, Germany. Under Hans Peterson's leadership, the rules for IMIA and the MEDINFOs have been documented in its Standing Orders. This reshaped IMIA into a genuine professional organization. Dynamic Field. Over the years, the field of medical informatics (also called health or biomedical informatics) has changed fundamentally. In the beginning, all activities centered around large information systems that gave support to the infrastructure of health care institutions (e.g., primary care systems or hospital information systems). At the same early time, attention was paid to smaller, but special-purpose systems, such as those for clinical laboratories or bio-signal processing, like ECG analysis. Later, the field was extended to include medical image processing and knowledge processing. Gradually, also networking and electronic communication came into play, and we are now in the middle of another wave of changes: communication and integration, and the support of patient care at home, reflected in the worldwide focus on computer-based patient records. In 1983, I wrote an article for the journal Methods of Information in Medicine (MIM) on A Comprehensive Model for Medical Information Processing. This model proposed six levels of complexity, ranging from: 1) simplest methods of using computers for communicating and recording data; 2) storage, retrieval, and databases; 3) computation and automation; 4) recognition and diagnosis; 5) therapy and control; to 6) the highest level of research and modeling. The last depends very much on specialist human knowledge and experience, because \u201csystems are continuously being changed as a function of our theoretical insight.\u201d Since then, I have written many articles in MIM highlighting topics such as the formalization of medical knowledge, the contrasting perspectives of medical informatics as art or science, how to advise for students in the discipline, and the role that curiosity plays as the \u201cdriving force behind all scientific endeavors\u201d. In 2016, Alexa McCray and I wrote a short article on the renewal of our discipline in the IMIA Yearbook synthesizing our ideas. Now, the next wave is already merging a wide range of knowledge processing with electronic patient record data. I continue to see a great role for IMIA as a \u2018bridge\u2019 organization both within an inter- organizational context and within the broader context of IMIA\u2019s professional aims. IMIA\u2019s members, both academic and corporate, have grown considerably, and besides these interdisciplinary efforts, the organization has ensured that scientists, researchers, practitioners, and educators are all successfully contributing internationally to helping those needing the newest developments in biomedical and healthcare informatics. ", "Alain Venot": "Professor of Medical Informatics and Biostatistics Paris Descartes University (1986-2002) Paris North University (2002-2015) Professor emeritus (2015- ) I discover medical informatics: In 1965, after my high school diploma (baccalaur\u00e9at in french), I started simultaneously studies in medicine and physics, ending with a Master\u2019s in automatics. In this context, I became interested by mathematical modeling of medico-biological processes at a time where analog computers were still used. A. Venot, MD, PhD In 1969, when I was still very young (20 years old) I discovered informatics and its recent applications to medicine, at a summer school taught by Professor Fran\u00e7ois Gr\u00e9my at Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00e9triere medical school in Paris. I was very interested, convinced of the great potential of these approaches to improve medicine and I decided to work in this scientific domain. 47 years later, I am still continuing! 1973-1979 I carry out my first researches and publications (in the domain of mathematical modeling of biomedical processes): I learned more in-depth numerical methods of simulation and identification of medical processes when working with Jean- Fran\u00e7ois Boisvieux (future Professor of medical informatics) at Gerbios (V\u00e9lizy, France), a private research center led by Jacques Richalet. In this lab, I carried out my first research leading to scientific publications. I was young and fascinated by the applications of Mathematics in medicine. I wanted to model the dynamics of uptake of radio substances injected in human beings to compute parameters quantifying the function of an organ (e.g. the total number of hepatocytes or Kupffer cells in the liver of a patient), My main work was the development of a non linear model of the uptake of radiocolloids by Kupffer cells. At that time, BMHI didn\u2019t exist as a medical discipline and, I was working as an assistant professor of Biophysics in a nuclear medicine department (Cochin university hospital). But at the end of this period, I became less convinced of the interest of these approaches in Medicine and decided to change my scientific themes. 1980-1991 I transpose mathematical modeling approaches to medical image comparison problems: Practicing nuclear medicine, I noticed that the comparison of images of the same organ of a patient at different times was difficult to carry out visually, due to both variations in the acquisition parameters of the images and evolution of patient disease. I used a mathematical modeling approach to describe the variations of these acquisition parameters and global optimization methods for the estimation of these parameters, using expensive array processors developed by Floating Point Systems company for the calculations. I developed robust image registration methods published in 1984. It was recently my satisfaction to read that the article presenting these new methods 32 years ago, has been still cited three times in 2015. I extended these methods to various medical and non-medical imaging techniques. Afterwards, I was also involved in the development of quantification of coloured skin phenomena (erythema, melanoma, healing kinetics\u2026). This period has been fruitful and brought me much satisfaction. \u2022 I got another PhD (Mathematics);  \u2022 I started to supervise theses; \u2022 The methods that I developed were rapidly taught in certain master\u2019s degrees and led to industrial applications (double tracer studies in nuclear medicine, digitized angiography, photrichograms in cosmetology\u2026); \u2022 These methods have led to extensions made by others (i.e., E. Walter, L. Pronzato) both from the methodological and application standpoints. During this period, I had the opportunity to leave Biophysics and to become an assistant professor of Biomedical and Health Informatics (BMHI) in 1983 and Full professor in 1986 at Cochin medical school, part of the Ren\u00e9 Descartes University in Paris. In 1986, I considered that my works carried out in the field of image processing could have been done by non-medical researchers. Again, I decided to change progressively my scientific themes for better valuing both my scientific and medical education, and therefore developing new systems nearer to Public Health than image processing systems. This led me to symbolic information processing in medicine 1991- 2000 I leave numerical medical information for symbolic information. I switch towards the development of drug prescription systems based on drug bases: After my works in medical image processing, I had a long collaboration with colleagues (Professors Strauch, Kahan, Weber) working in the domain of therapeutics and drug development (phase 1, 2, 3 studies). They created a new center performing these studies at our university (GIP Eclimed). I became the deputy director of this center and acquired a deeper knowledge of drug information. Publications demonstrated that drug prescription made by physicians was often inadequate and I was convinced that BMHI could contribute to solve this problem. This led me to initiate and be the scientific director of the OPADE European project (Optimization of drug prescription using advanced informatics) coordinated by Dr. Isabelle De Zegher from the BIM company (Brussels). During this project and later, we carried out work on more effective representations of clinical drug information in drug databases (namely with B. S\u00e9n\u00e9, C. Duclos, C. Milstein) so that drug information can be efficiently used by drug prescription systems. This work led us to propose structured representations of drug indications, drug contraindications and drug regimens. 2001-2006 I evolve towards guideline-based drug ordering systems: Many clinical guidelines were developed describing the best ways of taking care of patient with chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes\u2026). Many physicians were not aware of the therapeutical strategies described in these papers or electronic guideline documents. Computerized systems developed for the entry of prescriptions could improve the safety of the prescribed drugs but couldn\u2019t assist in the choice of the best therapeutical strategies. With B. S\u00e9roussi, J. Bouaud, H. Falcoff, and others, we developed the national ASTI project with the aim of developing a decision system with two modes of functioning for critiquing the prescription of a physician or for proposing the best therapeutical strategy. At the end of this project we had demonstrated that it is possible to implement efficiently therapeutical guidelines for chronic diseases, but a strong limitation was the considerable effort necessary for the maintenance of such tools. 2006-present Developing tools for facilitating the use of textual information by physicians and their reasonings rather than proposing ready to use solutions (with C. Duclos, J.B. Lamy, R. Tsopra): When a physician wants to solve a medical problem when taking care of a patient, they can often find the solution by reading textual documents. But this is time-consuming, and the cognitive load can be high. We started  to develop and continue to develop graphical approaches to facilitate the use of textual information contained in documents such as medical records, drug monographs and clinical guidelines. This approach was based on the development of the VCM language, which permits one to represent graphically abstract concepts in medicine such as diseases, symptoms, and drugs. We have also developed tools for facilitating the comparison of properties of drugs having the same indications. In the specific domain of antibiotic therapy, we are working on tools made for facilitating the reasoning of physician for the choice of the preferred antibiotics. Teaching aspects: Since 1983, I have been involved in the teaching of medical informatics both for medical students during their medical curriculum and for scientists and physicians at the level of a Master\u2019s degree. From 1991 to 2015, I have been responsible or co-responsible with P. Degoulet and P. Le Beux for a Master\u2019s in biomedical informatics which was organized on a national basis with colleagues coming from various universities in France. I have contributed to incorporate medical informatics as a mandatory discipline during medical studies. Our Master\u2019s degree (still alive!) trained around 400 students in biomedical informatics and has been a major tool for training specialists of BMHI in France. Some conclusions: The future of biomedical informatics and its impact on medicine. I don\u2019t regret my involvement in BMHI during all these years. For 45 years I have been working with pleasure. My career has not been perfectly coherent, having switched from numerical to symbolic approaches in BMHI. But this was the result of a critical analysis of my own activity. I wanted to have a research more in tune with my position of professor of medical informatics, this discipline belonging to public health in France. Computerization of medical processes is very slow and difficult. A lot has still to be done. But I remain optimistic for the future, if computerized tools developed in medicine lead to assist physicians without trying to replace them. Collaborations with specialists of cognitive and behavioural sciences appear to me particularly important for the good acceptance and efficient use of the tools derived from BMHI. ", "Patrick Weber": "Vice Chair, Administration & Finance, IMIA NI Past President, EFMI & Vice President, IMIA Chair, Nursing Informatics, EFMI Co-Founder, Swiss Nursing Informatics Since the beginning, I was attracted to technology. At nursing school, for my diploma in 1986 I chose to test an electronic thermometer to replace the traditional mercury one. During my RN work at the University Hospital of Lausanne, I was trained to be a private pilot for single engine planes, and this was also the beginning of the installation of a helicopter rescue operation based in Lausanne. Naturally I worked with them as flight assistant and on the rescue team from the beginning, and for the next 10 years. The early 1980\u2019s at the hospital was the era of the mainframe - very expensive and very big machines being used for administrative purposes \u2013 and not accessible to physicians or nurses. It was also the beginning of personal computers. The personal computer began to be available with two 5 \u00bc floppy disks, and since the hospital refused to finance this acquisition, I had to buy the first one on my own, despite it being very expensive at the time. Then I became responsible for a 30 bed ward for which I had to prepare the rostering for nurses every month. This is a difficult task with many rules and perfect for computerization. Two programmers and I worked on defining the rules. This system on DOS took more than a year to develop during our free time. I presented this work at NI 1988 in Dublin. I showed a magnificent photo of the screen in photo slides, and the system worked quite well, but regretfully it did not interest my colleagues: it was premature! At this time, I was the only nurse with a PC because I had bought it out of my own pocket. I calculated all the statistics needed for directing work with this machine. My nursing career allowed me to become chief of a department and director of nursing and as a result was able to initiate various projects using IT in nursing. This is why in 1991, I had to choose between staying at the hospital where no assistance was provided to develop IT, or leaving the hospital to build my own company \u2013 NICE Computing SA. This was also the time when I was studying for a master\u2019s degree together with a diploma of director of the nursing department. I decided to quit the safety of a hospital salaried position and begin my own start-up company. Initially, I tried to commercialize the rostering system, but because of the lack of funding I had to abandon this effort. In the early 1990\u2019s, I also tried to find a good tool to measure nursing workload, for which I collaborated with colleagues in Belgium with their RIM system. I worked with Leuven university and evaluated the system at three differents hospitals in Switzerland, with results comparable to those found in Belgium. When I approached the government, I was told that it is not necessary to measure nursing activity at the time. For about 8 years I then worked as a teacher and consultant for IT applications in nursing. I also worked at the Geneva University Hospital in the development of a search tool using natural language processing for ICD 9, and later ICD 10. This was successful, and the tool was distributed to all hospitals in the region. Since I like challenges, in 1998 we participated in the European project SynEx which was the beginning of exploring interoperability. In 2001 we participated in the WRAPIN European Project which is used  by Health-On-the-Net (HON) to this day. In 1999 I joined a group in a large company and started to have a team for development, which allowed us to produce a sophisticated and efficient tool for extracting medical statistics based on ICD and DRG codes. We also developed very good software for scheduling procedures in the operating room and anesthesia statistics. However, the company decided in 2001 that the healthcare domain was not profitable and they ask me to continue alone with just two developers. The tool for the operating room, first installed in 2001, was modified in 2005 to minimize the need for maintenance, which enabled it to work for another 10 years. After it was discontinued in 2015 the hospital regretted the decision. Another system development we undertook involved a server for GS1 code dedicated to hospital\u2019s needs, which, unfortunately also proved premature, since the hospital was not ready to appreciate the advantages of having a worldwide system for traceability. Today, they are finally ready, so we are working again on this server with an eight-year-old system. Due to the interruption of maintenance of the operating room system we had to change direction, and since we were experts in coding and DRGs, it led us to develop expertise in coding. Now we are a leader in quality control for coding and DRG, so that during NI2016 in Geneva, all badges had a real GS1 Datamatrix. Now, in addition to the DRG control we have returned to the nursing workload system together with the company LEP, still working to promote GS1. And, to add to our challenges, we organized the NI2016 conference in Geneva: I am always open to new challenges. New Media and Society, 2014; 16:941-957 ", "Ove B. Wigertz": "Professor Emeritus and Former Chair Department of Medical Informatics, Health Science Faculty and School of Engineering Linkoping University, Sweden Fellow of ACMI I was awarded a Doctor of Medical Science degree in Physiology (Work Physiology) in 1971 from the Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm after receiving a Master of Electrical Engineering degree in 1960 and a Doctor of Science degree in Automatic Control (including computer simulation) in 1963 from the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm. I have been a teacher, research associate and associate professor at the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, and at Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, until I moved to Link\u00f6ping University in 1973 to set up one of the first Departments of Medical Informatics in Europe. I have done considerable basic and applied research in Biomedical Engineering and Instrumentation, Cardiovascular and Work Physiology and in several Medical Informatics fields including Knowledge Based Representation, Knowledge Based Systems and Controlled Vocabularies. I am author and co-author of 235 publications. In 1967, I was awarded the annual Erna Ebeling Fund Prize from the Swedish Society of Medical Sciences for achievement in the design and development of instruments and systems for physiological research. Together with research associates and students I won the Gold Medal (the prize for one of the three best papers) at MEDINFO 80 in Tokyo, Japan, as well as the Gold Medal (prize for the best paper) awarded at MEDINFO 95 in Vancouver, Canada. Other professional commissions have involved being Chairman of the Swedish Association of Academic Professors (1991-1994), Chairman of the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping (1993-1996), Chairman of the Swedish Society of Biomedical Physics and Engineering (1975-1977), and Chairman of the Swedish Society of Medical Informatics (1978-1981). I have served as a member of the Editorial Boards of \u201cMethods of Information in Medicine\u201d, \u201cComputers and Biomedical Research\u201d and \u201cTechnology and Health Care\u201d. I was also Co-editor of the Proceedings of MEDINFO 83 in Amsterdam in August 1983, and served on the Organizing Committee Chairman of the Conference \u201cComputers in Cardiology 1985\u201d at Link\u00f6ping University. I was Visiting Professor at Tokyo University in 1985 and at the University of Utah in 1986-1987. During my stay at the University of Utah I participated actively in the early discussions to create the Arden Syntax for Computer- based Medical Decision Making. Going back to the beginning of my professional work on founding the Department of Medical Informatics at Link\u00f6ping University in 1973, I designed the curriculum for the discipline to include education and research. Ideas and examples (models) were taken mainly from the European activities in France at l\u2019Hospital Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re, Paris led by Professor Fran\u00e7ois Gr\u00e9my (1929 - 2014), and from the Institute for Medical Informatics at Hannover Medical School in Germany led by Professor Peter L. Reichertz (1930-  1987), Germany. At Link\u00f6ping, the Department of Medical Informatics was a division of the Department of Bio-medical Engineering. Our courses in Medical Informatics were adopted to complement and integrate with other Bio-medical Engineering Courses. We defined medical informatics as how to extract, process, present and store clinically relevant information in its different forms such as Text, Discrete Measurements Values, Time Courses, Estimated Volumes, Image Extractions and Interpretations. Moreover, we worked on the development of intelligent software tools for information retrieval, knowledge representation for clinical decision support, concept representation systems, terminology services, electronic medical record systems (EHR) data analysis and data mining. Methods to attain new types of information were continuously being developed and the detail and quality of recorded data increased rapidly. We cooperated with the Regional Hospitals to assist in creating the first implementations of EHRs as well as National Health Quality Registers. Some projects were in cooperation with developments within Bio-Medical Engineering in order not only to find novel ways of measuring and acquiring new health parameters, but also to interpret and store them efficiently together with other pertinent patient data. Specifically, we were engaged in several cooperative projects regarding patient monitoring data and long-term data collection like 24-hour ECG recordings and their interpretation using Holter technology. One of my own interests within Medical Informatics has been to efficiently use and process medical data to arrive at a diagnosis, and give advice for patient management (reminders) and treatments, as in knowledge-based systems. Since we saw that this would benefit from a higher language that would help in formulating medical rules and procedures, in 1984 I got the opportunity for closer study of such a system by spending almost a year at Dr. Homer Warner\u2019s Department at LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City, getting a closer look at, and even working to some extent with their HELP System (Health Evaluation through Logical Processing). At the same time, I took part in discussions\u2014mainly with George Hripcsak and Paul Clayton\u2014leading to the creation of the Arden Syntax. Derived initially from HELP and the Regenstrief Medical Record System (RMRS), the Arden Syntax defines medical logic that can be encoded as independent rules, such as reminders and alerts, with the hope of creating a public library of rules. It was first vetted at an informatics retreat held in 1989 at Columbia University's Arden Homestead. The syntax was intended to not only be readable by expert clinicians, but to also provide powerful array processing, which was achieved largely through the programming language APL. The syntax was improved and implemented by a number of researchers and vendors in the early 1990's and was initially adopted by the consensus standards organization, the American Society for Testing and Materials. After returning to Link\u00f6ping our Department of Medical Informatics got involved in a number of similar projects. Building on the experience and inspiration of working with HELP and Arden Syntax, the work at our Department came to include several projects within the general area of representation of medical knowledge and integration of medical decision modules. We found it important to develop software that would allow us to integrate logical decision modules with different medical data bases and other information systems. When we saw that knowledge support could be useful in one information system, such as a clinical information system (EHR) we were anxious to have such a module representation format to be usable in other EHRs. Several of our projects and work during the 1990\u2019s concentrated on this. We worked together with both nearby hospitals and regions on a national level with mainly national support but also joined European groups in international projects with funding from the European Union.  The need for vocabulary standards and processing became obvious and resulted in our involvement in practical testing and evaluation implementing SNOMED CT in specific areas, such as the transfer of discharge summaries from hospital care within a region (county) to a municipal home care facility. Another area was the transfer of information from the EHR system at hospitals in three counties to the Swedish Stroke Register, a national quality register. Lessons learned include the observation that mapping EHR template components and other EHR objects to SNOMED CT concepts holds potential benefits, regardless of whether one\u2019s EHR system can handle mappings. Several projects were aimed at evaluation of how developed IT systems were actually used in practice and in one project we aimed to gain knowledge on how these systems could increase the quality of care in home care in contrast to geographically distributed care. A European project \u2013 HELIOS\u2014together with Professor Patrice Degoulet, Paris\u2014 aimed at creating an integrated Software Engineering Environment (SEE) to facilitate the development and maintenance of medical applications in general. It was made up of a set of software components, communicating through a software bus. The Division of Medical Informatics of Link\u00f6ping was one of the members of the HELIOS project, and the aim was to provide methods and tools for development and realization of data-driven decision support that can be integrated into ward information systems. The DSS components included tools for knowledge acquisition and knowledge base construction, provided trigger mechanisms for knowledge base evocation, and an inference engine, controlling the execution. The work is based on the Arden Syntax which has allowed medical logic modules (MLMs) to be shared and transferred between institutions. Another collaborative project was KUSIVAR, which was part of KUSIN-MED, a Nordic research program dealing with the application of medical knowledge-based systems. KUSIVAR was a collaborative research project involving the Medical Intensive Care Unit at South Hospital, Stockholm, Siemens Elema AB, and Unisys AB. This collaboration resulted in a knowledge-based decision-support system called VentEx. The VentEx system was built to support ventilator therapy management using knowledge- based systems technology. A different project, PT-pol was designed to support anticoagulant therapy. This is a critical management issue in the sense that the therapeutic window for anticoagulant drugs is very narrow and an inaccurate dose might have life- threatening effects. Doses which are too high can cause bleeding and doses which are too low can increase the risk for thrombosis. Thus it is essential to manage this patient group carefully, with regular and frequent check-ups absolutely required. The application area is well suited for computer-based decision support, and a system with a knowledge base written as Medical Logic Modules (MLMs) according to the Arden syntax knowledge representation was built and implemented. After I became emeritus, the Department of Medical Informatics at Link\u00f6ping University was headed by Prof. PhD Hans Knutsson, with a background in Image Processing. Medical Image Processing is of course an important part of Medical Informatics and expands the usefulness of support hospital care into the 21st Century. ", "Alfred Winter": "Professor of Medical Informatics, University of Leipzig Former Chair, Hospital Information Systems Working Group, GMDS Motivation. In high school (Gymnasium in German), I really liked mathematics. However, I could not imagine how to make a living from dealing with formulas and theorems all my life. At that time, I hardly had heard anything about computers, but computer science or informatics seemed to be a useful application of mathematics for me. Moreover, this science promised to bring some value for society. This motivated my\u2026 first step: RWTH Aachen University. In 1977, I started my studies in computer science and operations research in Aachen. Shortly afterwards, the German government planned a nationwide population census and there was an intense debate at this time about the effect on the economy and the loss of jobs from computerization. Both of these public issues and discussions prompted me to search for an application of informatics, which would bring value to society. Thanks to Professor Rudolf Repges, I found in Medical Informatics a scientific discipline of this kind. In in the research group of Thomas Tolxdorff I became acquainted with medical image processing. This was very helpful because now I could show some pictures of the brain to my parents, which helped them to understand what I was working on. Unfortunately, there were no more exciting pictures when I later changed to database theory and database tools for hospital information systems. However, this way I came to know Reinhold Haux, later my PhD supervisor and my academic teacher. Since then he has been a good friend of mine. Goal of Medical Informatics. From Reinhold, I learned to understand that Medical Informatics is a problem-oriented discipline. This means that the goal of Medical Informatics is, and has to be, to solve problems in medicine. This goal has provided me with guidance for my entire professional life: regardless of what I might be working on as a Medical Informatics scientist, I always had to check, whether it would at least contribute to a solution of a medical problem. This encouraged me to take the\u2026 second step: Heidelberg University, where Peter Haas introduced me to a fantastic team of young researchers and software engineers. Despite successfully developing modern, customizable software products for clinical applications, we had to learn, that even for a University Hospital buying application software on the market is quite often more efficient. Luckily, Reinhold became Professor at Heidelberg University and my boss. Encouraged by him I drilled down into semantic data models and figured out that Codd\u2019s RM/T model is a perfect basis for easy to use uni-relational database interfaces (for my PhD). Later, I went on to widen my scope a little bit more to broach the entire system of information processing in a hospital. I was interested in models being able to describe such complex and heterogeneous systems in such a way that chief information officers would have a reliable overview of the system for which they are responsible. This resulted in the meta-model 3LGM\u00b2 for my Habilitation.  Special Interests. It was in Heidelberg, when I found out that developing precise models for complex human artefacts especially in the field of the management of information systems is my major field of interest. However, we do not only need good models, we also need a precise terminology for describing information system artefacts as well as for the tasks of information management. This brought me to the\u2026 third step: Leipzig University, where I became a professor of Medical Informatics. Thanks to Professor Markus L\u00f6ffler, who still chairs our department, I widened my personal scope again and realized, that the information system of a university hospital does not only have to support patient care processes but has to support medical research as well. With a most inspiring team in Leipzig we have advanced 3LGM\u00b2 and developed a suitable tool for its application. We have combined this modelling approach with a refined terminology for information management and layered this down by describing it in a textbook about Health Information Systems. It was a great honor for me to become the first author of its second edition \u2013 following Reinhold Haux, who signed off as being responsible for the first one. Medical Informatics in general and Information Management in particular need to be more orientated to morals and ethics. In a Germany-wide, multidisciplinary team of well-acknowledged experts, we have developed ethical guidelines for Medical Informatics, Biometry, Epidemiology and Health Data Management in the German context, which are accepted by the GMDS, the German scientific association for these disciplines. During the last few years, one of my personal research focuses has been on ontologies for information management. However, being the member of a small but strong network of scientists in Computer Science, Business and Information Systems Engineering and Medical Informatics has added a new perspective. Together we have found that this is time for customer and patient empowerment. A paradigm shift from orchestrating services by technology and commercial providers to customer-enabled orchestration of complex services is definitely needed! Since last year, our department has taken a leading role in a consortium of seven German university hospitals. This collaboration is designed to result in data integration centers for sharing data between healthcare and research as well as between different health care providers. Again a chance for widening my scope. So far you may have seen that there is a\u2026 Need for a Community of researchers, otherwise new ideas will hardly come up or lead to implementations of better systems for patients and healthcare practitioners. Throughout my career, the German Association for Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology (GMDS) provided to me the strong network I needed. During my time in Heidelberg, the GMDS gave me the chance to chair my first working group. In this group, researchers of various disciplines from all parts of the country gathered and we finally defined precisely the terms \u2018hospital information system\u2019 and \u2018information management\u2019. Now I am president of this association. During the last four years, I had the honour to take on an active role in the European Federation of Medical Informatics (EFMI) as well. Meeting renowned scientists from all over Europe and becoming friends with them, is\u2026 What I consider a privilege which has been granted to me as a researcher in the field of Medical Informatics. It is a privilege as well, to have a highly motivated team at home in Leipzig. "}
